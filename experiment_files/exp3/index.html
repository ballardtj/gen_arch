            <p><b><center>How well can you multi-task?</center></b></p>\
             <p>Thank you for participating in our study! This debrief will provide some background information about the study.\
              The purpose of this study was to examine how individuals prioritise goals in a multi-tasking environment, \
              and how prioritisation is influenced by how far the goal is from being achieved, and how long you have to achieve it.</p> \
              <p>Due to the complex nature of the workplace, people are frequently put in situations where they must prioritise one task over another.\
             One example of this is a farmer having to manage different crops during the growing season. Another example is a doctor attempting to maximise the\
             effectiveness of a treatment, whilst minimising a patient's pain. Because effective decision making is important for maximising performance,\
             we need to understand how people make these types of decisions.<p> \
             <p>Two factors that are known to influence decision making are how far the goal is from being achieved, and how long one has to achieve it.\
             Previous research has found that when people are simultaneously managing multiple goals, they tend to prioritise goals that are farther from being achieved.\
             Research also has suggested that deadlines influence prioritisation, however the effects of deadline are less clear.</p>\
            <p>In this experiment, we manipulated how far each goal was from being achieved by varying the starting heights of the crops. \
            We manipulated deadline by varying the number of weeks in the growing season. Together the starting height of the crop \
            and the length of the growing season determined how difficult the height goal was to achieve. We predicted that people would be more likely \
            to prioritise goals that were moderately difficult compared to goals that were easier to achieve (e.g. goals that had high starting heights \
              or long growing seasons) and goals that were harder to achieve (e.g. goals that had low starting heights or short growing seasons).</p>\
