1) Better way to plot predictives to showcase differences in st vs no-st model?

2) Look at surface plots at individual level

3) Look at clusters of participants. Need to think through priors for hierarchical model. Getting a sense of how people are distributed on the spatial axis. Possible standard deviation to small? Also possible bimodality?
