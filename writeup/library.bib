abstract = {Sequential sampling of evidence, or evidence accumulation, has been implemented in a variety of models to explain a range of multialternative choice phenomena. But the existing models do not agree on what, exactly, the evidence is that is accumulated. They also do not agree on how this evidence is accumulated. In this article, we use findings from process-tracing studies to constrain the evidence accumulation process. With these constraints, we extend the decision by sampling model and propose the multialternative decision by sampling (MDbS) model. In MDbS, the evidence accumulated is outcomes of pairwise ordinal comparisons between attribute values. MDbS provides a quantitative account of the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects equal to that of other models, and captures a wider range of empirical phenomena than other models.},

abstract = {Bayesian statistics, a currently controversial viewpoint concerning statistical inference, is based on a definition of probability as a par-ticular measure of the opinions of ideally consistent people. Statistical inference is modification of these opinions in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem specifies how such modifications should be made. The tools of Bayesian statistics include the theory of specific distributions and the principle of stable estimation, which specifies when actual prior opinions may be satisfactorily approximated by a uniform distribution. A common feature of many classical significance tests is that a sharp null hypothesis is compared with a diffuse alternative hypothesis. Often evidence which, for a Bayesian statistician, strikingly supports the null hypothesis leads to rejection of that hypothesis by standard classical procedures.},

abstract = {We re-examine behavioral patterns of intertemporal choice with recognition that time preferences may be inherently variable, focusing in particular on the explanatory power of an exponential discounting model with variable discount factors – the variable exponential model. We provide analytical results showing that this model can generate systematically different choice patterns from an exponential discounting model with a fixed discount factor. The variable exponential model accounts for the common behavioral pattern of decreasing impatience, which is typically attributed to hyperbolic discounting. The variable exponential model also generates violations of strong stochastic transitivity in choices involving intertemporal dominance. We present the results of two experiments designed to evaluate the variable exponential model in terms of quantitative fit to individual-level choice data. Data from these experiments reveal that allowing for a variable discount factor significantly improves the fit of the exponential model, and that a variable exponential model provides a better account of individual-level choice probabilities than hyperbolic discounting models. In a third experiment we find evidence of strong stochastic transitivity violations when intertemporal dominance is involved, in accordance with the variable exponential model. Overall, our analytical and experimental results indicate that exponential discounting can explain intertemporal choice behavior that was supposed to be beyond its descriptive scope if the discount factor is permitted to vary at random. Our results also highlight the importance of allowing for different sources of randomness in choice modeling.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of cognition measure individual differences in cognitive processes, such as processing speed, working memory capacity, and executive functions, that may underlie general intelligence. As such, cognitive models allow identifying associations between specific cognitive processes and tracking the effect of experimental interventions aimed at the enhancement of intelligence on mediating process parameters. Moreover, cognitive models provide an explicit theoretical formalization of theories regarding specific cognitive process that may help overcoming ambiguities in the interpretation of fuzzy verbal theories. In this paper, we give an overview of the advantages of cognitive modeling in intelligence research and present models in the domains of processing speed, working memory, and selective attention that may be of particular interest for intelligence research. Moreover, we provide guidelines for the application of cognitive models in intelligence research, including data collection, the evaluation of model fit, and statistical analyses.},

abstract = {The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has a near-ubiquitous presence in the neuroscience of cognitive control. It has been implicated in a diversity of functions, from reward processing and performance monitoring to the execution of control and action selection. Here, we propose that this diversity can be understood in terms of a single underlying function: allocation of control based on an evaluation of the expected value of control (EVC). We present a normative model of EVC that integrates three critical factors: the expected payoff from a controlled process, the amount of control that must be invested to achieve that payoff, and the cost in terms of cognitive effort. We propose that dACC integrates this information, using it to determine whether, where and how much control to allocate. We then consider how the EVC model can explain the diverse array of findings concerning dACC function},

We discuss some contemporary forms of structural equation models (SEMs) based on the inclusion of latent variables. The specific goals of this review are to clarify basic SEM definitions, consider relations to classical models, focus on testable features of the new models, and provide recent references to more complete presentations. A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

Such " goal gradient helping " occurs in part because late-stage efforts provide donors with a heightened sense of personal impact, an influential source of satisfaction from prosocial acts. Using web robot technology in an Internet field study of micro-lending, Study 1 demonstrated that charity contribution rates increase as recipients approach their fundraising goals. Study 2, a large-scale field experiment, found that funds close to reaching campaign goals received more donations than did funds far from reaching campaign goals. Study 3 replicated the goal gradient helping effect in a controlled scenario experiment, and mediational analyses showed that increased perceived impact of late-stage contributions, and the resultant satisfaction from this impact, explain goal gradient helping. In conclusion, people are not charitable simply to be kind or to relieve negative emotions; they find satisfaction from having personal influence in solving a social problem.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model capable of predicting variability in the mental workload experienced by frontline operators under routine and nonroutine conditions. BACKGROUND: Excess workload is a risk that needs to be managed in safety-critical industries. Predictive models are needed to manage this risk effectively yet are difficult to develop. Much of the difficulty stems from the fact that workload prediction is a multilevel problem. METHOD: A multilevel workload model was developed in Study I with data collected from an en route air traffic management center. Dynamic density metrics were used to predict variability in workload within and between work units while controlling for variability among raters.The model was cross-validated in Studies 2 and 3 with the use of a high-fidelity simulator. RESULTS: Reported workload generally remained within the bounds of the 90{\%} prediction interval in Studies 2 and 3. Workload crossed the upper bound of the prediction interval only under nonroutine conditions. Qualitative analyses suggest that nonroutine events caused workload to cross the upper bound of the prediction interval because the controllers could not manage their workload strategically. CONCLUSION: The model performed well under both routine and nonroutine conditions and over different patterns of workload variation. APPLICATION: Workload prediction models can be used to support both strategic and tactical workload management. Strategic uses include the analysis of historical and projected workflows and the assessment of staffing needs.Tactical uses include the dynamic reallocation of resources to meet changes in demand.},

The focus of this comment is on the limitations inherent in natural language (i.e., verbal) theories and critiques, which the research regarding self-efficacy has highlighted and Bandura's editorial underscores. Specifically, it is argued that Bandura's comment is replete with rhetorical fallacies and theo-retical contradictions. Several examples are described to both provide a tutorial on rhetorical sleight of hand and to set the record straight. Computational modeling and logical reasoning are presented as an alternative approach to better scientific theorizing and critique. Colleagues tell me it is an honor when a famous psychologist highlights one's work, even if it is in derision. I have been thus honored twice. Albert Bandura, rated as the fourth most eminent psychologist in the 20th century (Haggbloom et al., 2002), first criticized my work in 2003 in a paper with Edwin Locke, an equally eminent industrial–organizational psychologist. I responded to that critique with my own article-length review of control theory (Vancouver, 2005), which is the theoretical approach I take and the primary target of the Bandura–Locke critique. I and others also addressed their critique empirically},

abstract = {In the last years, research on risky choice has moved beyond analyzing choices only. Models have been suggested that aim to describe the underlying cognitive processes and some studies have tested process predictions of these models. Prominent approaches are evidence accumulation models such as decision field theory (DFT), simple serial heuristic models such as the adaptive toolbox, and connectionist approaches such as the parallel constraint satisfaction (PCS) model. In two studies involving measures of attention and pupil dilation, we investigate hypotheses derived from these models in choices between two gambles with two outcomes each. We show that attention to an outcome of a gamble increases with its probability and its value and that attention shifts toward the subsequently favored gamble after about two thirds of the decision process, indicating a gaze-cascade effect. Information search occurs mostly within-gambles, and the direction of search does not change over the course of decision making. Pupil dilation, which reflects both cognitive effort and arousal, increases during the decision process and increases with mean expected value. Overall, the results support aspects of automatic integration models for risky choice such as DFT and PCS, but in their current specification none of them can account for the full pattern of results.},

abstract = {Many day-to-day decisions involving risk are based on a person's memory for the past sequence of outcomes. The study of sequential decision making investigates how individuals use information about the past sequence of outcomes in order to make risky decisions. In this article, a random walk decision model called the confidence strength model is evaluated which was designed to describe the cognitive processes individuals use to combine sequential information provided by event patterns with payoff information in a sequential decision-making task. Two related experiments are reported which were designed to test various assumptions of the confidence strength model. The particular task used to study sequential decision making was the differential payoff paradigm in which the decision maker was required to predict which of two uncertain events would occur on each trial. Following each choice, feedback was presented in the form of differential monetary payoffs which were contingent on the alternative-event combination occurring on that trial. Payoffs were manipulated by varying the loss for incorrect decisions associated with each alternative, and sequential information was manipulated by constructing event sequences with a fixed distribution of run lengths within each block of trials. The response measures included the proportion of trials one alternative was chosen over another and also the average choice speed for each alternative. The main theoretical result was that the confidence strength model provided a good overall fit to the pattern of results for the choice proportion measure, and also accounted for a majority fo the findings obtained from the choice speed measures, although there were some minor exceptions. The confidence strength model provided a better account of the present results and previous research than several alternative choice models that were considered.},

abstract = {This research used resource allocation theory to generate predictions regarding dynamic relationships between self-efficacy and task performance from 2 levels of analysis and specificity. Participants were given multiple trials of practice on an air traffic control task. Measures of task-specific self-efficacy and performance were taken at repeated intervals. The authors used multilevel analysis to demonstrate differential and dynamic effects. As predicted, task-specific self-efficacy was negatively associated with task performance at the within-person level. On the other hand, average levels of task-specific self-efficacy were positively related to performance at the between-persons level and mediated the effect of general self-efficacy. The key findings from this research relate to dynamic effects--these results show that self-efficacy effects can change over time, but it depends on the level of analysis and specificity at which self-efficacy is conceptualized. These novel findings emphasize the importance of conceptualizing self-efficacy within a multilevel and multispecificity framework and make a significant contribution to understanding the way this construct relates to task performance.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t A commonly voiced concern with the Bayes factor is that, unlike many other Bayesian and non-Bayesian quantitative measures of model evaluation, it is highly sensitive to the parameter prior. This paper argues that, when dealing with psychological models that are quantitatively instantiated theories, being sensitive to the prior is an attractive feature of a model evaluation measure. This assertion follows from the observation that in psychological models parameters are not completely unknown, but correspond to psychological variables about which theory often exists. This theory can be formally captured in the prior range and prior distribution of the parameters, indicating which parameter values are allowed, likely, unlikely and forbidden. Because the prior is a vehicle for expressing psychological theory, it should, like the model equation, be considered as an integral part of the model. It is argued that the combined practice of building models using informative priors, and evaluating models using prior sensitive measures advances knowledge.},

We applied our framework to cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to investigate the expected parameter discrimination achieved by current research practices. Our approach revealed several regularities in the ability of recent decision sets to recover CPT parameters. We analyzed 3 decision sets and we found that (a) the randomly generated stimuli performed just as well as the researcher designed stimuli, (b) outcome magnitude impacted the recoverability of parameters, and (c) even under ideal circumstances, the parameters representing loss aversion and choice sensitivity were associated with large amounts of error in their estimates. Our analysis is the first to accurately predict the relative estimation precision of each parameter of CPT. We additionally applied our framework to analyze the decision sets that were used to produce the empirical evidence for the description– experience gap. Specifically, we found that choices based on few experienced draws from a gamble provided little information for estimating decision weights when compared to equivalent description based choices. Therefore, choices between expe-rienced gambles can be explained by a wider range of decision weights than choices between equivalent described gambles, providing an alternative explanation for the empirical evidence surrounding the description– experience gap. We conclude with implications for future experiments designed to estimate parameters from choice data.},

abstract = {People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cul- tures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of indi- viduals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interde- pendence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motiva- tion; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion, and motivation.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses to monetary rewards in the human nucleus accumbens, a structure previously demonstrated to encode reference-dependent reward information. The magnitude of accumbens activation was found to vary with reward outcome, but also with the degree of mental effort demanded to obtain individual rewards. For a fixed level of reward, accumbens was less strongly activated following a high demand for effort than following a lower demand. The magnitude of this effect was noted to correlate with preceding activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region that has been proposed to monitor information-processing demands and to mediate in the subjective experience of effort.

In contrast, when people have made substantial progress and are approaching the goal attainment, they downplay the achieved progress in their mental representation to create greater perceived discrepancy, hence eliciting greater effort.

abstract = {Information from others can be unreliable. Humans nevertheless act on such information, including gossip, to make various social calculations, thus raising the question of whether individuals can sort through social information to identify what is, in fact, true. Inspired by empirical literature on people's decision-making when considering gossip, we built an agent-based simulation model to examine how well simple decision rules could make sense of information as it propagated through a network. Our simulations revealed that a minimalistic decision-rule 'Bit-wise mode' - which compared information from multiple sources and then sought a consensus majority for each component bit within the message - was consistently the most successful at converging upon the truth. This decision rule attained high relative fitness even in maximally noisy networks, composed entirely of nodes that distorted the message. The rule was also superior to other decision rules regardless of its frequency in the population. Simulations carried out with variable agent memory constraints, different numbers of observers who initiated information propagation, and a variety of network types suggested that the single most important factor in making sense of information was the number of independent sources that agents could consult.

However, the theory implies two potentially independent definitions of these inclinations, the self-guide versus the reference-point definitions. Two scales (the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire, Higgins al., 2001, and the General Regulatory Focus Measure, Lockwood, Jordan, {\&} Kunda, 2002) have been widely used to measure dispositional regulatory focus. We suggest that these two scales align respectively with the two definitions, and find that the two scales are largely uncorrelated. Both conceptual and methodological implications are discussed.},

abstract = {The authors analyzed longitudinal data from a cognitive training experiment—Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly— using several alternative contemporary statistical models to test dynamic hypotheses based on latent change scores. The analyses focused on pretest and posttest data for only the group who received Reasoning training compared with the No-Contact (control) group. The initial structural equation modeling (SEM) path model isolated several training effects and an important source of transfer of training, Near3Far, but this transfer was not increased due to training. The subsequent models, which accounted for pretest differences and latent changes, implied that only the Near measurements were influenced by training, and the change transfer was small. Introduction of common factors for both Near and Far measurements showed the factor patterns were unaffected by training or time and suggested training was a broader effect than in any single variable. The bivariate analysis of common factors did not appear to alter the previous results. Addition of demographic covariates and latent mixture analysis of the trained group led to further results. The uses of contemporary SEMs with experimental data are discussed.},

Using functional MRI we found differential brain activations to the verbal and social cues embedded in the choice problems. In large group contexts, framing effects were significant where participants were more risk seeking under the negative (loss) framing than under the positive (gain) framing. This behavioral difference in risk preference was mainly regulated by the activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, including the homologue of the Broca's area. In contrast, framing effects diminished in small group contexts while the insula and parietal lobe in the right hemisphere were distinctively activated, suggesting an important role of emotion in switching choice preference from an indecisive mode to a more consistent risk-taking inclination, governed by a kith-and-kin decision rationality.},

This research seeks to leverage task-based interfaces, where the human operator guides a fleet of decentralized UVs via high-level goals as opposed to individual vehicle control. In such decentralized control architectures, each vehicle computes its locally best plan to accomplish the mission goals with shared information. The results of two experiments are described where 62 participants performed multi-UV missions in an existing decentralized multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment under increasing task load. Results suggest that a system which uses a task-based interface and decentralized control algorithms may be robust to task load increases by mitigating operator cognitive overload.},

abstract = {As part of the " Fatigue and Performance Modeling Workshop, " six modeling teams made predictions for temporal profiles of fatigue and performance in five different scenarios. One scenario was based on a laboratory study of fatigue and performance during 88 h of extended wakefulness with or without nap opportunities. Another scenario was based on a field study of alertness in freight locomotive engineers. Two scenarios were based on laboratory studies with various conditions of chronic sleep restriction and recovery. There was a theoretical scenario for future ultra-long-range flight operations as well. Experimental data were available for all scenarios except the latter. The model predictions were compared with the experimental data; after linear scaling using mixed-effects regression, mean square errors were computed to quantify goodness-of-fit. The six models were also compared among each other on the basis of these mean square errors. The present paper provides detailed information about the results of these comparisons. The models were capable of predicting the data for some scenarios fairly well. However, predicting the data for the two scenarios involving chronic sleep restriction was more problematic. Differences among the predic-tions from the six models were relatively small, suggesting that these models have a broad common basis. More experimental research is needed to yield new insights for the further development of fatigue and performance models. A S PART OF THE PREPARATIONS for the Fatigue and Performance Modeling Workshop held in Se-attle, WA, on June 13 and 14, 2002, predictions of hu-man fatigue and performance were solicited for four different sleep/wake/work scenarios from the mathe-matical modeling community in this area. Six modeling teams responded and provided model predictions for at least three of the scenarios. These predictions were then compared with experimental data available from recent experiments for three of the four scenarios. A fifth scenario was presented to the six modeling teams at the Workshop proper. Model predictions for this scenario provided at the end of the first day of the Workshop were compared overnight to the data from a recent experiment as well. The results of all the comparisons of model predictions to experimental data were presented on the second day of the Workshop. The present paper represents the contents of this presentation, expanded with some additional analyses based on the discussion that followed the presentation. The six modeling teams and their corresponding fa-tigue and performance models (25) are listed in Table I. They are given labels A through F by which they will be referred to throughout the paper. The Workshop aimed to compare and contrast the features and capabilities of these fatigue and performance models and to identify critical gaps in fatigue and performance research (34). No modeling team had any advance knowledge about the fatigue and performance data or metrics corre-sponding to the scenarios, and none of the six models was developed, tested, or validated using the scenarios or their data, except where noted otherwise in the text below. The modeling teams were also not informed about literature sources pertaining to any of the scenar-ios prior to the Fatigue and Performance Modeling Workshop. Key questions that the Workshop aimed to address included: " Where do current models converge? " and " What is missing from the current models? " (34). For this reason, sleep/wake/work scenarios were selected so as to be challenging to the existing fatigue and per-formance models. The five scenarios are presented in the next section. The subsequent section describes the statistical methodology used to compare the model pre-dictions to the experimental data. The results of the comparisons are shown in a series of figures and tables, and these results are discussed at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {The ability to achieve ones goals is a defining characteristic of intelligent behaviour. A great many existing theories, systems and research programmes address the problems associated with generating behaviour to achieve a goal; much fewer address the related problems of how and why goals should be generated in an intelligent artifact, and how a subset of all possible goals are selected as the focus of behaviour. It is research into these problems of motivation, which this article aims to stimulate. Building from the analysis of a scenario involving a futuristic household robot, we extend an existing account of motivation in intelligent systems to provide a framework for surveying relevant literature in AI and robotics. This framework guides us to look at the problems of encoding drives (how the needs of the system are represented), goal generation (how particular instances of goals are generated from the drives with reference to the current state), and goal selection (how the system determines which goal instances to act on). After surveying a variety of existing approaches in these terms, we build on the results of the survey to sketch a design for a new motive management framework which goes beyond the current state of the art. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding individual differences in cognitive performance is an important part of understanding how variations in underlying cognitive processes can result in variations in task performance. However, the exploration of individual differences in the components of the decision process – such as cognitive processing speed, response caution, and motor execution speed – in previous research has been limited. Here, we assess the heritability of the components of the decision process, with heritability having been a common aspect of individual differences research within other areas of cognition. Importantly, a limitation of previous work on cognitive heritability is the underlying assumption that variability in response times solely reflects variability in the speed of cognitive processing. This as-sumption has been problematic in other domains, due to the confounding effects of caution and motor execution speed on observed response times. We extend a cognitive model of decision-making to account for relatedness structure in a twin study paradigm. This ap-proach can separately quantify different contributions to the heritability of response time. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we find strong evidence for the heri-tability of response caution, and more ambiguous evidence for the heritability of cognitive processing speed and motor execution speed. Our study suggests that the assumption made in previous studies – that the heritability of cognitive ability is based on cognitive processing speed – may be incorrect.

As a new construct introduced in 2002, the notion of pacing style has intuitive appeal, but has been under-researched, in part, due to a measurement need. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to improve the conceptualisation of pacing style and to develop and validate a new scale-based measure. The result was the nine-item Pacing Action Categories of Effort Distribution (PACED), consisting of deadline (complete work in a short time period just before the due date), steady (spread task activities evenly over time), and U-shaped (invest most of the effort at the start and finish of a task, with a break in between) action styles. Across eight independent samples of students, faculty, and organisational employees, we examined the dimensionality, inter- nal consistency, stability (temporal and situational), and validity (construct, convergent, discriminant, predictive) of PACED. Results support the use of PACED as a reliable and valid measure, and we discuss several research avenues that would benefit from incorporating the concept of pacing style. INTRODUCTION},

In two different experiments, subjects were given a choice between a certain alternative that produced a single known payoff and an uncertain alternative that produced a normal distribution of payoffs. Initially this distribution was unknown, and in the first experiment it was learned through feedback from past decisions, whereas in the second experiment it was learned by observing sample outcomes. In the first experiment, a response deadline was used to limit the amount of time available for making a decision. In the second experiment, an observation cost was used to limit the number of samples that could be purchased. The mean and variance of the uncertain alternative and the value of the certain alternative were factorially manipulated to study their joint effects on choice probability, choice response time (Experiment 1), and number of observations purchased (Experiment 2). Algebraic-deterministic theories developed for decision making with simple gambles fail to explain the present results.

We tested the model in two correlational field studies (Study 1, N = 197; Study 2, N = 110). Our analyses supported the general model. Across both studies, self-reported anger during goal pursuit is negatively related to later goal achievement through a decrease in persistence when participants' action planning is low. When action planning was reported to be high, anger was unrelated to persistence and goal achievement.

Persons classified as high in the motive to approach success and low in the motive to avoid failure (M, {\textgreater} Mi) performed better than 5s for whom Mt {\textgreater} M» on groups of word pairs that 5s were told were of intermediate difficulty (ID), whereas no difference in performance was found on items designated as easy or difficult. The results were as predicted by the model. An additional finding was a significant pattern of the avoidance of ID items by the Mt {\textgreater} M, group, a result not found in previous studies. The present study was designed to test the model for achievement-motivated behavior proposed by Atkinson (1957, 1964), using a performance task that permitted the sys-tematic variation of subjective probability of success (P g) levels. This was done using a modified verbal paired-associated (PA) learn-ing task. By color-coding the word pairs, three groups of items known to be of equal difficulty were identified to subjects as being either very easy (E), very difficult (D), or of intermediate difficulty (ID). The Atkinson model postulates that the strength of motivation to engage in an achievement activity is a function of the tendency to approach success (T s) and the tendency to avoid failure (T t). T s is assumed to be a multiplicative function of the motive (i.e., relatively stable personality disposition) to approach success (M s), the subjective probability that performance will eventuate in success (P B), and the incentive value of success (7 S). Likewise, T {\{} is a multiplicative function of the motive to avoid failure (M f), the subjective probability of failure (Pf), and the incentive value of failure (7 f). T s and T t are assumed to combine additively, and the resultant strength of the tendency to approach an achievement task can be written: T t -T t = (M B XP B X I,)-(M t XP t X I t).}},

Experiment 1 compares the ability of the CPT and SP/A models to account for the same within-subjects data set and finds in favor of SP/A. Experiment 2 replicates the main finding of Experiment 1 in a between-subjects design. The final discussion brackets the SP/A result by showing the impact on fit of both decreasing and increasing the number of free parameters. We also suggest how the SP/A approach might be useful in modeling investment decision making in a descriptively more valid way and conclude with comments on the relation between descriptive and normative theories of risky choice.

abstract = {A full range of psychological processes has been put into play to explain judgment and choice phenomena. Complementing work on attention, information integration, and learning, decision research over the past 10 years has also examined the effects of goals, mental representation, and memory processes. In addition to deliberative processes, automatic processes have gotten closer attention, and the emotions revolution has put affective processes on a footing equal to cognitive ones. Psychological process models provide natural predictions about individual differences and lifespan changes and integrate across judgment and decision making (JDM) phenomena. "Mindful" JDM research leverages our knowledge about psychological processes into causal explanations for important judgment and choice regularities, emphasizing the adaptive use of an abundance of processing alternatives. Such explanations supplement and support existing mathematical descriptions of phenomena such as loss aversion or hyperbolic discounting. Unlike such descriptions, they also provide entry points for interventions designed to help people overcome judgments or choices considered undesirable.},

abstract = {With reduced radar signatures, increased endurance and the removal of humans from immediate threat, uninhabited (also known as unmanned) ae- rial vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable assets to militarized forces. UAVs require human guidance to varying degrees and often through several operators. However, with current military focus on stream- lining operations, increasing automation, and reducing manning, there has been an increasing effort to design systems such that the current many-to- one ratio of operators to vehicles can be inverted. An increasing body of literature has examined the effectiveness of a single operator controlling multiple uninhabited aerial vehicles. While there have been numerous ex- perimental studies that have examined contextually how many UAVs a single operator could control, there is a distinct gap in developing predic- tive models for operator capacity. In this chapter, we will discuss previous experimental research for multiple UAV control, as well as previous at- tempts to develop predictive models for operator capacity based on tempo- ral measures. We extend this previous research by explicitly considering a cost-performance model that relates operator performance to mission costs and complexity. We conclude with a meta-analysis of the temporal meth- ods outlined and provide recommendation for future applications.},

abstract = {Framing effects occur in a wide range of laboratory and natural decision contexts, but the underlying processes that produce framing effects are not well understood. We explored the role of working memory (WM) in framing by manipulating WM loads during risky decisions. After starting with a hypothetical stake of money, participants were then presented a lesser amount that they could keep for certain (positive frame) or lose for certain (negative frame). They made a choice between the sure amount and a gamble in which they could either keep or lose all of the original stake. On half of the trials, the choice was made while maintaining a concurrent WM load of random letters. In both load and no-load conditions, we replicated the typical finding of risk aversion with positive frames and risk seeking with negative frames. In addition, people made fewer decisions to accept the gamble under conditions of higher cognitive load. The data are congruent with a dual-process reasoning framework in which people employ a heuristic to make satisfactory decisions with minimal effort.},

Discussions of impulsiveness in the literature of economics, sociology, social psychology, dynamic psychology and psychiatry, behavioral psychology, and "behavior therapy" are reviewed. Impulsiveness seems to be best accounted for by the hyperbolic curves that have been found to describe the decline in effectiveness of rewards as the rewards are delayed from the time of choice. Such curves predict a reliable change of choice between some alternative rewards as a function of time. This change of choice provides a rationale for the known kinds of impulse control and relates them to several hitherto perplexing phenomena: behavioral rigidity, time-out from positive reinforcement, willpower, self-reward, compulsive traits, projection, boredom, and the capacity of punishing stimuli to attract attention.

abstract = {Emotion or stress can jeopardize decision-making relevance and cognitive functioning. In this paper we examine plan continuation error (PCE), an erroneous behavior defined as a "failure to revise a flight plan despite emerging evidence that suggests it is no longer safe" (. Orasanu et al., 2001). Our hypothesis is that negative emotional consequences attached to the go-around decision provoke a temporary impairment of the decision-making process and favor PCE. We investigated this hypothesis with a simplified landing task in which two possible contributors to those emotions, namely the uncertainty of a decision outcome and the reward/punishment, associated to the outcome were manipulated. A behavioral experiment (n=12) and a second one (n=6) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted. Behavioral results of both studies showed the effectiveness of the financial incentive to bias decision making toward a more risky and less rational behavior from a safety point of view. Neuroimaging data showed that the PCE behavior was underpinned by the contribution of brain circuitry of emotion and reward during the decision-making process. Taken together, behavioral and fMRI result support the hypothesis that PCE can be provoked by a temporary impairment of rational decision-making due to the negative emotional consequences attached with the go-around. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Three hypotheses of forgetting from immediate memory were tested: time-based decay, decreasing temporal distinctiveness, and interference. The hypotheses were represented by 3 models of serial recall: the primacy model, the SIMPLE (scale-independent memory, perception, and learning) model, and the SOB (serial order in a box) model, respectively. The models were fit to 2 experiments investigating the effect of filled delays between items at encoding or at recall. Short delays between items, filled with articulatory suppression, led to massive impairment of memory relative to a no-delay baseline. Extending the delays had little additional effect, suggesting that the passage of time alone does not cause forgetting. Adding a choice reaction task in the delay periods to block attention-based rehearsal did not change these results. The interference-based SOB fit the data best; the primacy model overpredicted the effect of lengthening delays, and SIMPLE was unable to explain the effect of delays at encoding. The authors conclude that purely temporal views of forgetting are inadequate.},

To evaluate such models, their parameters are typically tested for relationships with behavioral and physiological variables that are thought to reflect specific cognitive processes. However , many models do not come equipped with the statistical framework needed to relate model parameters to covariates. Instead, researchers often revert to classifying participants into groups depending on their values on the covariates, and subsequently comparing the estimated model parameters between these groups. Here we develop a comprehensive solution to the covariate problem in the form of a Bayesian regression framework. Our framework can be easily added to existing cognitive models and allows researchers to quantify the evidential support for relationships between covariates and model parameters using Bayes factors. Moreover , we present a simulation study that demonstrates the superiority of the Bayesian regression framework to the conventional classification-based approach.},

We suggest that people may view ownership as a kind of credit given to agents responsible for making possession of a non-owned object possible. On this view, judgments about the establishment of ownership depend on attributions of responsibility. We report three experiments showing that people's judgments about the establishment of ownership are influenced by an agent's intent and control in bringing about an outcome, factors that also affect attributions of responsibility. These findings demonstrate that people do not just consider who was first to possess an object in judging who owns it, and are broadly consistent with the view that ownership is acquired through labor. The findings also suggest that rather than exclusively being the product of social conventions, judgments about the establishment of ownership over non-owned things also depend on the psychological processes underlying the attribution of responsibility.},

The first study illustrates that the methods will often agree, both in motivating researchers to conclude that H1 is supported better than H0, and the other way round, that H0 is better supported than H1. The next four, however, show that the methods will also often disagree. In these cases, the aim of the paper will be to motivate the sensible evidential conclusion, and then see which approach matches those intu-itions. Specifically, it is shown that a high-powered non-sig-nificant result is consistent with no evidence for H0 over H1 worth mentioning, which a Bayes factor can show, and, con-versely, that a low-powered non-significant result is consistent with substantial evidence for H0 over H1, again indicated by Bayesian analyses. The fourth study illustrates that a high-powered significant result may not amount to any evidence for H1 over H0, matching the Bayesian conclusion. Finally, the fifth study illustrates that different theories can be eviden-tially supported to different degrees by the same data; a fact that P-values cannot reflect but Bayes factors can. It is argued that appropriate conclusions match the Bayesian inferences, but not those based on significance testing, where they disagree.},

abstract = {We investigate a question relevant to the psychology and neuroscience of perceptual decision-making: whether decisions are based on steadily accumulating evidence, or only on the most recent evidence. We report an empirical comparison between two of the most prominent examples of these theoretical positions, the diffusion model and the urgency-gating model, via model-based qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our findings support the predictions of the diffusion model over the urgency-gating model, and therefore, the notion that evidence accumulates without much decay. Gross qualitative patterns and fine structural details of the data are inconsistent with the notion that decisions are based only on the most recent evidence. More generally, we discuss some strengths and weaknesses of scientific methods that investigate quantitative models by distilling the formal models to qualitative predictions. For humans and many other animals, life presents a constant stream of decisions about basic survival, navigation, social interaction, and a host of other situations. For more than 50 years, a simple idea has provided the founda-tion of the study of decision making in neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and economics: the idea of " evidence accumulation " . Mathematical theories known as evidence accumulation models (EAMs) assume that decisions are made by gradually accumulating evidence from the environment in favor of each possible alterna-tive. The first alternative to accumulate a threshold amount of evidence is selected for action. Through variations in this basic theme, accumulator models of decision making have helped explain cognitive and neurophysiolog-ical aspects of decision making 1–6},

The first emphasizes the first few issues of the journal, which, in many ways, set us on a methodological course that we sail to this day, and then takes us through the mid-1920s. The second is the period through World War II, in which we see the roots of modern methodological concepts and techniques, including a transition from a discovery orientation to a hypotheticodeductive model orientation. The third takes us through roughly 1970, a period in which many of our modern-day practices were formed, such as reliance on null hypothesis significance testing. The fourth, from 1970 through 1989, sees an emphasis on the development of measures of critical constructs. The fifth takes us into the present, which is marked by greater plurality regarding data-analytic approaches. Finally, we offer a glimpse of possible and, from our perspective, desirable futures regarding research methods. Specifically, we highlight the need to conduct replications; study the exceptional and not just the average; improve the quality of the review process, particularly regarding methodological issues; emphasize design and measurement issues; and build and test more specific theories.},

This critical result is at odds with the standard reflection effect observed in description-based choice and explained by Prospect Theory. The so-called reversed-reflection effect has been predicated on the extreme-outcome rule, which suggests that memory biases affect risky choice from expe-rience. To test the general plausibility of the rule, we conducted two experiments examining how the magnitude of prospective outcomes impacts risk preferences. We found that while the reversed-reflection effect was present with small-magnitude payoffs, using payoffs of larger magni-tude brought participants' behavior back in line with the standard reflection effect. Our results suggest that risk pref-erences in experience-based decision-making are not only affected by the relative extremeness but also by the absolute extremeness of past events.},

@article{Piironen2017,
abstract = {The goal of this paper is to compare several widely used Bayesian model selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their differences and give rec-ommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classifica-tion and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the opti-mization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to rela-tively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If the encom-passing model is too complex, it can be robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outper-form also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive per-formance of the finally selected model.},

When the choice data are binary, a canonical method for making these types of predictions is the logistic choice model. This paper investigates whether it is possible to improve out-of-sample predictions by changing two aspects of the canonical approach: 1) Using response times in addition to the choice data, and 2) Combining them using a model from the psychology and neuroscience literature, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM). Two experiments compare the out-of-sample choice prediction accuracies of both methods and in both cases the DDM method outperforms a logistic prediction method. Furthermore, the DDM allows for out-of-sample process predictions. Both experiments validate the DDM as a method for predicting out-of-sample response times.},

Our study examines the factors that affect intended and unintended termination and the longevity of IJVs. The findings show that approximately 90 percent of all IJV terminations are unintended and 10 percent intended, and that the frequency of intended termination and unintended termination varies noticeably depending on the initial purposes of formation. This suggests that the termination of IJVs is significantly contingent on their formation. The findings also show that the longevity of IJVs varies according to the initial purposes of formation, the initial conditions under which the IJV is formed, and the types of unanticipated contingencies that it encounters. The key theoretical issues and practical implications of the distinction between the intended and unintended termination of IJVs are also discussed.},

abstract = {A future concept of operations for controlling unmanned vehicles has a single, forwarddeployed soldier supervising multiple, heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. This operator would collaborate with an automated planner that presents the operator with a choice of potential plans for how the unmanned vehicles could efficiently search the dynamic environment for new targets, track identified targets, and destroy hostile targets. A key step towards this future concept is to determine how often the automated planner should provide the operator with potential plans without causing a detrimentally high workload for the operator, which could have negative performance consequences. This research describes the development of the Onboard Planning System for Unmanned Vehicles Supporting Expeditionary Reconnaissance and Surveillance (OPS-USERS) testbed and an experiment to measure operator workload and performance in a set of scenarios with different replanning intervals. The results show that the replan interval has a significant effect on workload and performance with significantly lower performance at the lowest replan interval. Replanning too frequently in a human-on-the-loop collaboration can cause higher levels of workload and lower performance. Further research is required to determine the impact of low workload in a highly autonomous system on overall performance. Also, operator strategy and trust in automation with the OPS-USERS system deserves further research. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 by Clare, Hart, and Cummings.},

abstract = {Recent research investigating decisions from experience suggests that not all information is treated equally in the decision process, with more recently encountered information having a greater impact. We report 2 studies investigating how this differential treatment of sequentially encountered information affects subjective valuations of risky prospects when observations of past outcomes must be used to estimate the prospect's payoff distribution, and examine how individual differences in cognitive capacities influence information usage. In Study 1 we found that a sliding window of information model that averages a subset of (only) the most recently encountered outcomes (samples) fit the subjective valuation data for a portion of individuals better than models that integrate all observed outcomes. This pattern of results is replicated in Study 2, in which we also found that the amount of information used to form valuations varies greatly between individuals, and that individual difference in memory span explains a portion of this variation. Combined, these results suggest a process in which information usage is in part reliant on cognitive capacity, and where information aggregation appears to be memory based rather than online, providing new insight into the processes involved in the construction of valuation in experiential decisions.},

abstract = {I propose the index h, defined as the number of papers with citation number {\textgreater}h, as a useful index to characterize the scientific output of a researcher. citations ͉ impact ͉ unbiased F or the few scientists who earn a Nobel prize, the impact and relevance of their research is unquestionable. Among the rest of us, how does one quantify the cumulative impact and rele-vance of an individual's scientific research output? In a world of limited resources, such quantification (even if potentially dis-tasteful) is often needed for evaluation and comparison purposes (e.g., for university faculty recruitment and advancement, award of grants, etc.). The publication record of an individual and the citation record clearly are data that contain useful information. That informa-tion includes the number (N p) of papers published over n years, the number of citations (N c j) for each paper (j), the journals where the papers were published, their impact parameter, etc. This large amount of information will be evaluated with different criteria by different people. Here, I would like to propose a single number, the ''h index,'' as a particularly simple and useful way to characterize the scientific output of a researcher. A scientist has index h if h of his or her N p papers have at least h citations each and the other (N p Ϫ h) papers have Յh citations each. The research reported here concentrated on physicists; how-ever, I suggest that the h index should be useful for other scientific disciplines as well. (At the end of the paper I discuss some observations for the h index in biological sciences.) The highest h among physicists appears to be E. Witten's h, which is 110. That is, Witten has written 110 papers with at least 110 citations each. That gives a lower bound on the total number of citations to Witten's papers at h 2 ϭ 12,100. Of course, the total number of citations (N c,tot) will usually be much larger than h 2 , because h 2 both underestimates the total number of citations of the h most-cited papers and ignores the papers with Ͻh citations. The relation between N c,tot and h will depend on the detailed form of the particular distribution (1), and it is useful to define the proportionality constant a as N c,tot ϭ ah 2 . [1] I find empirically that a ranges between 3 and 5. Other prominent physicists with high hs are A. J. Heeger (h ϭ 107), M. L. Cohen (h ϭ 94), A. C. Gossard (h ϭ 94), P. W. Anderson (h ϭ 91), S. Weinberg (h ϭ 88), M. E. Fisher (h ϭ 88), M. Cardona (h ϭ 86), P. G. deGennes (h ϭ 79), J. N. Bahcall (h ϭ 77), Z. Fisk (h ϭ 75), D. J. Scalapino (h ϭ 75), G. Parisi (h ϭ 73), S. G. Louie (h ϭ 70), R. Jackiw (h ϭ 69), F. Wilczek (h ϭ 68), C. Vafa (h ϭ 66), M. B. Maple (h ϭ 66), D. J. Gross (h ϭ 66), M. S. Dresselhaus (h ϭ 62), and S. W. Hawking (h ϭ 62). I argue that h is preferable to other single-number criteria commonly used to evaluate scientific output of a researcher, as follows: (i) Total number of papers (N p). Advantage: measures pro-ductivity. Disadvantage: does not measure importance or impact of papers. (ii) Total number of citations (N c,tot). Advantage: measures total impact. Disadvantage: hard to find and may be inflated by a small number of ''big hits,'' which may not be repre-sentative of the individual if he or she is a coauthor with many others on those papers. In such cases, the relation in Eq. 1 will imply a very atypical value of a, Ͼ5. Another disadvantage is that N c,tot gives undue weight to highly cited review articles versus original research contributions. (iii) Citations per paper (i.e., ratio of N c,tot to N p). Advantage: allows comparison of scientists of different ages. Disadvan-tage: hard to find, rewards low productivity, and penalizes high productivity. (iv) Number of ''significant papers,'' defined as the number of papers with Ͼy citations (for example, y ϭ 50). Advantage: eliminates the disadvantages of criteria i, ii, and iii and gives an idea of broad and sustained impact. Disadvantage: y is arbitrary and will randomly favor or disfavor individuals, and y needs to be adjusted for different levels of seniority. (v) Number of citations to each of the q most-cited papers (for example, q ϭ 5). Advantage: overcomes many of the disadvantages of the criteria above. Disadvantage: It is not a single number, making it more difficult to obtain and compare. Also, q is arbitrary and will randomly favor and disfavor individuals.},

abstract = {Evidence accumulations models (EAMs) have become the dominant modeling framework within rapid decision-making, using choice response time distributions to make inferences about the underlying decision process. These models are often applied to empirical data as "measurement tools", with different theoretical accounts being contrasted within the framework of the model. Some method is then needed to decide between these competing theoretical accounts, as only assessing the models on their ability to fit trends in the empirical data ignores model flexibility, and therefore, creates a bias towards more flexible models. However, there is no objectively optimal method to select between models, with methods varying in both their computational tractability and theoretical basis. I provide a systematic comparison between nine different model selection methods using a popular EAM-the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA; Brown {\&} Heathcote, Cognitive Psychology 57(3), 153-178 2008)-in a large-scale simulation study and the empirical data of Dutilh et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 1-19 2018). I find that the "predictive accuracy" class of methods (i.e., the Akaike Information Criterion [AIC], the Deviance Information Criterion [DIC], and the Widely Applicable Information Criterion [WAIC]) make different inferences to the "Bayes factor" class of methods (i.e., the Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC], and Bayes factors) in many, but not all, instances, and that the simpler methods (i.e., AIC and BIC) make inferences that are highly consistent with their more complex counterparts. These findings suggest that researchers should be able to use simpler "parameter counting" methods when applying the LBA and be confident in their inferences, but that researchers need to carefully consider and justify the general class of model selection method that they use, as different classes of methods often result in different inferences.},

abstract = {We examined latent change score (LCS) modeling as an approach to the analysis of children's skin conductance level (SCL) throughout a stressful task--a simulated inter-adult argument--as it relates to externalizing and internalizing symptoms. LCS is an extension of traditional multi-level modeling (MLM) which allows estimation of proportional growth terms. Children (Age 6 – 12 years; N = 150) were from two-parent families. Mothers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results indicated that the LCS models outperformed the traditional MLM. The use of LCS yielded important novel information regarding profile and pattern of responding for various children and is likely to advance understanding of relations between children's physiological responses and psychopathology symptoms. Electrodermal responding (EDR) is a widely studied psychophysiological measure considered to be an important index of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Relations between EDR during lab challenges and both externalizing (e.g., Posthumus, et al., 2009) and internalizing (e.g., Najstrom {\&} Jannson, 2006; Thayer, Friedman, {\&} Borkovec, 1996) problems have been examined for some time, typically by averaging EDR across a task. Although researchers continue with this approach, explication of EDR through real-time assessments is critical for providing estimates of how quickly individuals respond, the magnitude of response, and the speed at which individuals return to baseline (recovery). This study introduces latent change score modeling as an innovative statistical method for the examination of real-time changes in EDR and the study of mental health correlates of EDR.},

The authors showed that a large congruency effect (participants were faster to approach pleasant and avoid unpleasant stimuli, than to approach unpleasant and avoid pleasant stimuli) could be produced on a novel touchscreen paradigm (Experiment 1), and that the congruency effect could be reversed by spatial (Experiment 2) and nonspatial (Experiment 3) response effects. Thus, involuntary approach and avoid response activations are not fixed, but sensitive to context, and are specifically based on the desired goal.},

The model accounts for data from choice tasks using both time-controlled (e.g., response signal) and standard reaction time paradigms and its adequacy compares favorably with other approaches. A new paradigm that controls the time of arrival of information supporting different choice alternatives provides further support. The model captures choice behavior regardless of the number of alternatives, accounting for the log-linear relation between reaction time and number of alternatives (Hick's law) and explains a complex pattern of visual and contextual priming in visual word identification.},

abstract = {Purpose This research advances understanding of empiri-cal time modeling techniques in self-regulated learning research. We intuitively explain several such methods by situating their use in the extant literature. Further, we note key statistical and inferential assumptions of each method while making clear the inferential consequences of inat-tention to such assumptions. Design/Methodology/Approach Using a population model derived from a recent large-scale review of the training and work learning literature, we employ a Monte Carlo simu-lation fitting six variations of linear mixed models, seven variations of latent common factor models, and a single latent change score model to 1500 simulated datasets. Findings The latent change score model outperformed all six of the linear mixed models and all seven of the latent common factor models with respect to (1) estimation precision of the average learner improvement, (2) correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis about such average improvement, and (3) correctly failing to reject true null hypothesis about between-learner differences (i.e., random slopes) in average improvement. Implications The latent change score model is a more flexible method of modeling time in self-regulated learning research, particularly for learner processes consistent with twenty-first-century workplaces. Consequently, defaulting to linear mixed or latent common factor modeling methods may have adverse inferential consequences for better understanding self-regulated learning in twenty-first-cen-tury work. Originality/Value Ours is the first study to critically, rig-orously, and empirically evaluate self-regulated learning modeling methods and to provide a more flexible alterna-tive consistent with modern self-regulated learning knowledge.},

Moreover, the untested and untenable assumption that psychological phenomena can be partitioned into two types, we argue, has the consequence of systematically thwarting scientific progress.

As such, many challenges are presented in the effective coordination and management of these UAVs; converting the current n-to-1 paradigm (n operators operating a single UAV) to the 1-to-n paradigm (one operator managing n UAVs). This paper introduces an Information Abstraction methodology used to produce the functional capability framework initially proposed by Chen et al. and its Level Of Detail (LOD) indexing scale. This framework was validated through comparing the operator workload and Situation Awareness (SA) of three experiment scenarios involving multiple autonomously heterogeneous UAVs. The first scenario was set in a high LOD configuration with highly abstracted UAV functional information; the second scenario was set in a mixed LOD configuration; and the final scenario was set in a low LOD configuration with maximal UAV functional information. Results show that there is a significant statistical decrease in operator workload when a UAV's functional information is displayed at its physical form (low LOD - maximal information) when comparing to the mixed LOD configuration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most economic theories are based on the premise that individuals maximize their own self-interest and correctly incorporate the structure of their environment into all decisions, thanks to human intelligence. The influence of this paradigm goes far beyond academia-it underlies current macroeconomic and monetary policies, and is also an integral part of existing financial regulations. However, there is mounting empirical and experimental evidence, including the recent financial crisis, suggesting that humans do not always behave rationally, but often make seemingly random and suboptimal decisions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Here we propose to reconcile these contradictory perspectives by developing a simple binary-choice model that takes evolutionary consequences of decisions into account as well as the role of intelligence, which we define as any ability of an individual to increase its genetic success. If no intelligence is present, our model produces results consistent with prior literature and shows that risks that are independent across individuals in a generation generally lead to risk-neutral behaviors, but that risks that are correlated across a generation can lead to behaviors such as risk aversion, loss aversion, probability matching, and randomization. When intelligence is present the nature of risk also matters, and we show that even when risks are independent, either risk-neutral behavior or probability matching will occur depending upon the cost of intelligence in terms of reproductive success. In the case of correlated risks, we derive an implicit formula that shows how intelligence can emerge via selection, why it may be bounded, and how such bounds typically imply the coexistence of multiple levels and types of intelligence as a reflection of varying environmental conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Rational economic behavior in which individuals maximize their own self interest is only one of many possible types of behavior that arise from natural selection. The key to understanding which types of behavior are more likely to survive is how behavior affects reproductive success in a given population's environment. From this perspective, intelligence is naturally defined as behavior that increases the probability of reproductive success, and bounds on rationality are determined by physiological and environmental constraints.},

abstract = {Face perception, perhaps the most highly developed visual skill in humans, is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that is comprised of multiple, bilateral regions. We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.},

Cross-classification of task, team member, and organization member behaviors with proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity produced nine subdimensions of work role performance. Ratings from 491 supervisors from 32 organizations and self-ratings from employees in two organizations (n's = 1,228 and 927) supported the proposed distinctions.

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally conceptualised as a disorder of movement, but recent data suggest that motivational deficits may be more pervasive than previously thought. Here, we ask whether subclinical deficits in incentivised decision-making are present in PD and, if so, whether dopaminergic therapy ameliorates such deficits. We devised a novel paradigm in which participants decided whether they were willing to squeeze a hand-held dynamometer at varying levels of force for different magnitudes of reward. For each participant, we estimated the effort level at which the probability of accepting a reward was 50{\%} - the effort 'indifference point'. Patients with PD (N=26) were tested ON and OFF their usual dopaminergic medication, and their performance compared to those of age-matched controls (N=26). No participant was clinically apathetic as defined by the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS). Our data show that, regardless of medication status, patients with PD chose to engage less effort than controls for the lowest reward. Overall, however, dopamine had a motivating effect on participants' choice behaviour - patients with PD chose to invest more effort for a given reward when they were in the ON relative to OFF dopamine state. Importantly, this effect could not be attributed to motor facilitation. We conclude that deficits in incentivised decision-making are present in PD even in the absence of a clinical syndrome of apathy when rewards are low, but that dopamine acts to eliminate motivational deficits by promoting the allocation of effort.},

Distinguishing these domains highlights a need to marry two approaches to research methodology: the classical approach, which we describe as snapshot, bookend, between-group experimentation; and a microgenetic approach that traces proximal cause-effect bonds over time to validate theoretical accounts of how learning generates achievements. We argue for fusing these methods to advance a validated psychology of academic achievement.},

Evidence that the psychological justification for this behavior is predicated on the desire not to appear wasteful is presented. In a field study, customers who had initially paid more for a season subscription to a theater series attended more plays during the next 6 months, presumably because of their higher sunk cost in the season tickets. Several questionnaire studies corroborated and extended this finding. It is found that those who had incurred a sunk cost inflated their estimate of how likely a project was to succeed compared to the estimates of the same project by those who had not incurred a sunk cost. The basic sunk cost finding that people will throw good money after bad appears to be well described by prospect theory (D. Kahneman {\&} A. Tversky, 1979, Econometrica, 47, 263–291). Only moderate support for the contention that personal involvement increases the sunk cost effect is presented. The sunk cost effect was not lessened by having taken prior courses in economics. Finally, the sunk cost effect cannot be fully subsumed under any of several social psychological theories.},

abstract = {Warfighters are often subjected to challenging sleep/wake schedules that hinder their cognitive performance. Countermeasures, such as timely short naps and caffeine, are often used to mitigate the effects of sleep loss on performance. However, the timing, duration, and dosage of these countermeasures should be optimal (or near optimal) to maintain high levels of performance at the desired times. To this end, mathematical models that can accurately predict the detrimental effects of sleep loss and the restorative effects of different dosages of caffeine on performance could be of great utility. Here, we present a mathematical model that predicts individualized cognitive performance for subjects exposed to the continuum of sleep loss (from no sleep to partial sleep) while considering the recuperative effects of caffeine. In particular, we developed and validated both group-average and individual-specific models on performance data obtained from four different studies. Results from the first two studies showed that a group-average model developed on one study could accurately predict the temporal dynamics of both total and partial sleep loss in another study, with {\textgreater}75{\%} of the predictions falling within 2 standard errors of the measured data. The results also showed that, on average, individual-specific models provided {\~{}}30{\%} improved prediction accuracy compared with the group-average models. Importantly, we showed that once the model had been customized to an individual under total sleep loss, it could be directly applied to predict the same individual's performance under partial sleep loss, and vice versa. Results from the third and fourth studies showed that the group-average model that accounts for caffeine effects on performance can provide up to 90{\%} improved accuracy in capturing the effects of a range of caffeine doses (50-300 mg) over a model that does not account for caffeine. Here, individual-specific models provided up to 43{\%} improved accuracy in predicting caffeine effects on performance compared with caffeine-free models. Taken together, the proposed model is the first mathematical formulation that allows for the prediction of the effects of any form of sleep loss and the restorative effects of different dosages of caffeine on a specific individual's performance. When used as a decision-aid tool, this model provides the means to maximize Warfighter cognitive performance, resulting in peak alertness and prolonged alertness at the desired times.},

The measurement of response time (RT), the amount of time it takes to make a decision, offers a cost-effective and direct way to study the choice process. Yet, relatively little theory exists to guide the integration of RT into economic analysis. This article presents a canonical process model from psychology and neuroscience, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM), and shows that many RT phenomena in the economics literature are consistent with the predictions of the DDM. Additionally, use of the class of sequential sampling models facilitates a more principled consideration of findings from cognitive science and neuroeconomics. Application of the DDM demonstrates the rich inference made possible when using models that can jointly model choice and process, highlighting the need for more work in this area.},

abstract = {An increase in the common marginal value of a public good has two effects: it increases the benefit of a contribution to others, and it reduces the net cost of making a contribution. These two effects can be decomposed by letting a contribution have an 'internal' return for oneself that differs from the 'external' return to someone else. We use this framework in a series of one-shot public goods games in which subjects make choices in ten treatments with no feedback. Contributions are generally increasing in the external return and group size, which suggests that altruism in this context is not simply of the 'warm glow' variety, i.e. giving only for the sake of giving. Contributions are also increasing in the internal return, indicating that decisions are sensitive to the costs of helping others. We specify a logit equilibrium model in which individuals are motivated by own and others' earnings, and in which choice is stochastic. Maximum likelihood estimates of (representative–agent) altruism and logit parameters are significant and of reasonable magnitudes, and the resulting two-parameter model tracks the pattern of contributions across the ten treatments. A richer model reveals some differences in individual altruism coefficients, with more dispersion among male subjects.},

In the present article we survey research situated at this interface, considering work from cognitive and social psychology and behavioral economics, but with a particular focus on neuro-science research. We organize existing findings into three core areas, consid-ering them in the light of currently vying theoretical perspectives. Based on the accumulated evidence, we advocate for a view of control function that treats it as a domain of reward-based decision making. More broadly, we argue that neuroscientific evidence plays a critical role in understanding the mechanisms by which motivation and cognitive control interact. Opportu-nities for further cross-fertilization between behavioral and neuroscientific research are highlighted.},

One that figures prominently in hypothesis testing is the null ritual, the pitting of hypotheses against chance. Although known to be problematic, this practice is still widely used. One way to resist the lure of the null ritual is to increase the precision of theories by casting them as formal models. These can be tested against each other, instead of against chance, which in turn enables a researcher to decide between competing theories based on quantitative measures. This article gives an overview of the advantages of modeling, describes research that is based on it, outlines the difficulties associated with model testing, and summarizes some of the solutions for dealing with these difficulties.

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect on performance when several active processes compete for limited processing resources. The principles discussed show that conclusions about the interactions among psychological processes must be made with caution, and some existing assumptions may be unwarranted. When two (or more) processes use the same resources at the same time, they may both interfere with one another, neither may interfere with the other, or one may interfere with a second without any interference from the second process to the first. The important principles are that a process can be limited in its performance either by limits in the amount of available processing resources (such as memory or processing effort) or by limits in the quality of the data available to it. Competition among processes can affect a resource-limited process, but not a data-limited one. If a process continually makes preliminary results available even before it has completed all its operations, then it is possible to compute performance-resource operating characteristics that show how processes interact. A number of experiments from the psychological literature are examined according to these processing principles, resulting in some new interpretations of interactions among competing psychological processes. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

Similarly, shorter delay also has a positive effect. Moreover, schedulability is also a function of periods and deadlines. By taking into account the control performance and schedulability at the same time, this paper defines a period and deadline selection problem for fixed-priority systems. Our problem is to find the optimal periods and deadlines for given tasks that maximize the overall system performance. As our solution, this paper presents a novel heuristic algorithm that finds a high-quality suboptimal solution with very low complexity, which makes the algorithm practically applicable to large size task sets.},

abstract = {Proliferation in the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) in civil and military operations has presented a multitude of human factors challenges; from how to bridge the gap between demand and availability of trained operators, to how to organize and present data in meaningful ways. Utilizing the Design Research Methodology (DRM), a series of closely related studies with subject matter experts (SMEs) demonstrate how the focus of research gradually shifted from "how many systems can a single operator control" to "how to distribute missions among operators and systems in an efficient way". The first set of studies aimed to explore the modal number, i.e., how many systems can a single operator supervise and control. It was found that an experienced operator can supervise up to 15 UASs efficiently using moderate levels of automation, and control (mission and payload management) up to three systems. Once this limit was reached, a single operator's performance was compared to a team controlling the same number of systems. In general, teams led to better performances. Hence, shifting design efforts toward developing tools that support teamwork environments of multiple operators with multiple UASs (MOMU). In MOMU settings, when the tasks are similar or when areas of interest overlap, one operator seems to have an advantage over a team who needs to collaborate and coordinate. However, in all other cases, a team was advantageous over a single operator. Other findings and implications, as well as future directions for research are discussed.},

@article{Killeen2009,
abstract = {Goods remote in temporal, spatial, or social distance, or in likelihood, exert less control over our behavior than those more proximate. The decay of influence with distance, of perennial interest to behavioral economists, has had a renaissance in the study of delay discounting. By developing discount functions from marginal utilities, this article provides a framework that resolves several anomalies of intertemporal choice. Utilities are inferred to be power functions of monetary value, delay, and probability. Utility, not value, is discounted, with decisions made by adding the utility of a good to the disutility of a delay or contingency. The theory reduces to standard treatments, such as exponential, hyperbolic and hyperboloid, and exponential-power; naturally predicts magnitude effects and other asymmetries; is consistent with subadditivity, immediacy, and certainty effects; returns conjointly measured determinations of monetary utility and temporal distance functions; and is extensible to other dimensions of distance. Keywords: intertemporal choice, delay discount functions, dynamic inconsistency, magnitude effect, utility All problems of self-management involve establishing durable control by globally preferred goods-a long healthy life, college degree, promotion, attainment of heaven, or a legacy-in the face of smaller, more immediate temptations-rich food, sin, or cash settlements. When humans and other animals choose between delayed or distant commodities, they typically evince a number of peculiarities, among them: (a) They discount the future much more steeply than realistic; if offered a reliable {\$}100 in one year or an immediate settlement, for example, subjects will often settle for around {\$}70, implying an unrealistic 36{\%} compound discount rate. (b) Their discount functions are typically nonexponential. Exponential discount functions are the gold standard for valuation of deferred assets, with lenders compensated for deferring access to assets, as with certificates of deposit, by contracting an exponential increase in payout as a function of their period. When discount functions are not exponential they may show reversal of value over time: Subjects prefer a larger delayed good over a smaller, less delayed one, but as the passage of time makes the smaller one imminent, they impulsively take it. This is shown in a standard representation (see Figure 1) where a larger deferred good is preferred over a smaller, slightly more immediate reward-when both are temporally remote. As time passes, the difference in utility diminishes, until at time t , preference for the small immediate good becomes dominant. Exponential discount functions with the same discount rate will not cross at a point, as these do. These curves must either have different rate parameters, with the larger amount being discounted more slowly, or they must be of a different form; there is evidence for both conditions in the literature , as shown below. The discount functions that describe both verbal estimates of value and observed preference reversals are called hyper-bolic (v t v 0 /1 t, shown in Figure 1), or hyperboloid (v t v 0 /1 t ; Rachlin, 2006; Rodriguez {\&} Logue, 1988). The difficulties of understanding intertemporal preferences theoretically , and their signal importance for both personal and political economy, are well-described by Loewenstein and Elster (1992), with Madden and Bickel (2009) providing a current overview. Hyperbolic discount functions entail a more complicated actuarial system than the exponential: The discount rate is continually changing, with the consumer projecting a discount rate for a future epoch (e.g., next year) that is less than he or she will project for it at any subsequent time up to the start of that epoch. It is not just that the valuation during the year changes as the year progresses; the proportion by which it changes is also continuously changing. In contrast, the exponential discounter is consistent in applying the same rate at all times: His or her decrement depends only on the length of the epoch, not its remoteness from the decision point. The present research was motivated by the desire to simplify the imputed cognitive economics of decision makers, to rationalize it, and to provide a unified analytic tool for researchers. The present account starts from the most fundamental representation of devaluation, the marginal rate of discounting. It does so for several reasons. The marginal rate, or derivative of the discount function, is the heart of the "diminishing marginal utility" of Bernoulli, and identifies the marginal rate (Equation 1) that leads uniquely to exponential discount functions. The marginal rate gives birth to competing models of temporal discounting from a fundamental and intuitive level. Its integration between specific time (t) limits t 1 and t 2 gives the discount factor between those times, , which is a key object of many recent economic treatises. And finally, it starts with marginal rates because simple generalizations of the most basic marginal discount rate (Equation 1) led to a novel and accurate discount function that would not have been otherwise discovered.},

abstract = {Changes at work are often accompanied with the threat of, or actual, resource loss. Through an experiment, we investigated the detrimental effect of the threat of resource loss on adaptive task performance. Self-regulation (i.e., task focus and emotion control) was hypothesized to buffer the negative relationship between the threat of resource loss and adaptive task performance. Adaptation was conceptualized as relearning after a change in task execution rules. Threat of resource loss was manipulated for 100 participants undertaking an air traffic control task. Using discontinuous growth curve modeling, 2 kinds of adaptation—transition adaptation and reacquisition adaptation—were differentiated. The results showed that individuals who experienced the threat of resource loss had a stronger drop in performance (less transition adaptation) and a subsequent slower recovery (less reacquisition adaptation) compared with the control group who experienced no threat. Emotion control (but not task focus) moderated the relationship between the threat of resource loss and transition adaptation. In this respect, individuals who felt threatened but regulated their emotions performed better immediately after the task change (but not later on) compared with those individuals who felt threatened and did not regulate their emotions as well. However, later on, relearning (reacquisition adaptation) under the threat of resource loss was facilitated when individuals concentrated on the task at hand.

abstract = {Psychological theory is advanced through empirical tests of predictions derived from quantitative cognitive models. As cognitive models are developed and extended, they tend to increase in complexity–leading to more precise predictions–which places concomitant demands on the behavioral data used to discriminate between candidate theories. To aid discrimination between cognitive models and, more recently, to constrain parameter estimation, neural data have been used as an adjunct to behavioral data, or as a central stream of information, in the evaluation of cognitive models. Such a model-based neuroscience approach entails many advantages, including precise tests of hypotheses about brain–behavior relationships. There have, however, been few systematic investigations of the capacity for neural data to constrain the recovery of cognitive models. Through the lens of cognitive models of speeded decision-making, we investigated the efficiency of neural data to aid identification of latent cognitive states in models fit to behavioral data. We studied two theoretical frameworks that differed in their assumptions about the composition of the latent generating state. The first assumed that observed performance was generated from a mixture of discrete latent states. The second conceived of the latent state as dynamically varying along a continuous dimension. We used a simulation-based approach to compare recovery of latent data-generating states in neurally-informed versus neurally-uninformed cognitive models. We found that neurally-informed cognitive models were more reliably recovered under a discrete state representation than a continuous dimension representation for medium effect sizes, although recovery was difficult for small sample sizes and moderate noise in neural data. Recovery improved for both representations when a larger effect size differentiated the latent states. We conclude that neural data aids the identification of latent states in cognitive models, but different frameworks for quantitatively informing cognitive models with neural information have different model recovery efficiencies. We provide full worked examples and freely-available code to implement the two theoretical frameworks.},

abstract = {Although many forms of differential treatment based on group membership are perceived to be legitimate, disadvantaged group members' responses to discrimina- tion have been studied primarily in contexts in which such treatment is appraised as illegitimate. This has resulted in an impoverished understanding of differential group-based treatment and a failure to illuminate the processes by which discrimi- nation can shift from being seen as legitimate to being viewed as illegitimate. We discuss the determinants of disadvantaged group members' legitimacy appraisals and the de-legitimisation process, whereby forms of discrimination appraised as legitimate come to be increasingly perceived as illegitimate. Whether group-based exclusion is addressed collectively or individually depends on socio-structural factors such as the pervasiveness of discrimination, impermeability of intergroup boundaries, and the availability of cognitive alternatives to the status quo. We conclude that understanding the antecedents and consequences of legitimacy appraisals is necessary to develop a comprehensive account of disadvantaged group members' experiences of group-based discrimination.},

abstract = {In conventional structural equation models, all latent variables and indicators vary between units (typically subjects) and are assumed to be independent across units. The latter assumption is violated in multilevel settings where units are nested in clusters, leading to within-cluster de-pendence. Different approaches to extending structural equation models for such multilevel settings are examined. The most common approach is to formulate separate within-cluster and between-cluster models. An advantage of this set-up is that it allows software for conventional struc-tural equation models to be 'tricked' into estimating the model. However, the standard implementation of this approach does not permit cross-level paths from latent or observed variables at a higher level to latent or ob-served variables at a lower level, and does not allow for indicators varying at higher levels. A multilevel regression (or path) model formulation is therefore suggested in which some of the response variables and some of the explanatory variables at the different levels are latent and measured by multiple indicators. The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model-ing (GLLAMM) framework allows such models to be specified by simply letting the usual model for the structural part of a structural equation model include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. Models of this kind are applied to the U.S. sample of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 to investigate the relation-ship between the school-level latent variable 'teacher excellence' and the student-level latent variable 'reading ability', each measured by multiple ordinal indicators.},

abstract = {Research has identified a wide range of factors that influence performance in relative judgment tasks. However, the findings from this research have been inconsistent. Studies have varied with respect to the identification of causal variables and the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms underlying performance. Drawing on the ecological rationality approach, we present a theory of the judgment and decision-making processes involved in a relative judgment task that explains how people judge a stimulus and adapt their decision process to accommodate their own uncertainty associated with those judgments. Undergraduate participants performed a simulated air traffic control conflict detection task. Across two experiments, we systematically manipulated variables known to affect performance. In the first experiment, we manipulated the relative distances of aircraft to a common destination while holding aircraft speeds constant. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced a direct manipulation of relative speed. We then fit a sequential sampling model to the data, and used the best fitting parameters to infer the decision-making processes responsible for performance. Findings were consistent with the theory that people adapt to their own uncertainty by adjusting their criterion and the amount of time they take to collect evidence in order to make a more accurate decision. From a practical perspective, the paper demonstrates that one can use a sequential sampling model to understand performance in a dynamic environment, allowing one to make sense of and interpret complex patterns of empirical findings that would otherwise be difficult to interpret using standard statistical analyses.},

abstract = {The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is one of the most popular experimental paradigms for comparing com- plex decision-making across groups. Most commonly, IGT behavior is analyzed using frequentist tests to compare performance across groups, and to compare inferred param- eters of cognitive models developed for the IGT. Here, we present a Bayesian alternative based on Bayesian repeated- measures ANOVA for comparing performance, and a suite of three complementary model-based methods for assess- ing the cognitive processes underlying IGT performance. The three model-based methods involve Bayesian hierarchi- cal parameter estimation, Bayes factor model comparison, and Bayesian latent-mixture modeling. We illustrate these Bayesian methods by applying them to test the extent to which differences in intuitive versus deliberate decision style are associated with differences in IGT performance. The results show that intuitive and deliberate decision- makers behave similarly on the IGT, and the modeling analyses consistently suggest that both groups of decision- makers rely on similar cognitive processes. Our results challenge the notion that individual differences in intu- itive and deliberate decision styles have a broad impact on decision-making. They also highlight the advantages of Bayesian methods, especially their ability to quantify evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, and that they allow model-based analyses to incorporate hierarchical and latent-mixture structures.},

abstract = {The study of decision making has traditionally been dominated by axi- omatic utility theories. More recently, an alternative approach, which focuses on the micro-mechanisms of the underlying deliberation process, has been shown to account for several “paradoxes” in human choice behavior for which simple utility-based approaches cannot. Decision field theory (DFT) is a cognitive-dynamical model of decision making and preferential choice, built on the fundamental principle that deci- sions are based on the accumulation of subjective evaluations of choice alternatives until a threshold criterion is met. This article extends the basic DFT framework to the domain of dynamic decision making.DFT-Dynamic is proposed as a newalternative to normative backward induction. Through its attention to the processes underlying plan- ning and deliberation DFT-D provides simple, emergent explanations for violations of choice principles traditionally taken as evidence of irrationality. A recent multi- stage decision making study is used to showcase the model's efficacy for developing cognitive models of individual strategies.},

In the present study, we analyzed the behavioral and neuroanatomical effects of protein malnutrition (PM) postweaning in mice. Starting at 20-21 d of age, male ddY mice were maintained on a 5{\%} casein diet (PM group) or 20{\%} casein diet (control group) for 20 d. On the 20th d, body and brain weights of PM mice were lower than those of the control group. PM mice exhibited excessive alertness and spontaneous activity under novel conditions in the Irwin test. In addition, PM mice showed increased open arm exploration in the elevated plus maze compared to control mice. These results suggest that hyperactivity and reduced anxiety behavior or higher impulsiveness in PM mice could be due to an immature brain.},

In a second experiment, we show that this behavior is learned quickly (within 2–3 min over several discrete trials) and remained stable for as long as the payoff function did not change. The results of this work show that people are adaptive and flexible in how they prioritize and allocate attention in a dual-task setting.

abstract = {The tri-reference point (TRP) theory takes into account minimum requirements (MR), the status quo (SQ), and goals (G) in decision making under risk. The 3 reference points demarcate risky outcomes and risk perception into 4 functional regions: success (expected value of x ≥ G), gain (SQ {\textless} × {\textless} G), loss (MR ≤ x {\textless} SQ), and failure (x {\textless} MR). The psychological impact of achieving or failing to achieve these reference points is rank ordered as MR {\textgreater} G {\textgreater} SQ. We present TRP assumptions and value functions and a mathematical formalization of the theory. We conducted empirical tests of crucial TRP predictions using both explicit and implicit reference points. We show that decision makers consider both G and MR and give greater weight to MR than G, indicating failure aversion (i.e., the disutility of a failure is greater than the utility of a success in the same task) in addition to loss aversion (i.e., the disutility of a loss is greater than the utility of the same amount of gain). Captured by a double-S shaped value function with 3 inflection points, risk preferences switched between risk seeking and risk aversion when the distribution of a gamble straddled a different reference point. The existence of MR (not G) significantly shifted choice preference toward risk aversion even when the outcome distribution of a gamble was well above the MR. Single reference point based models such as prospect theory cannot consistently account for these findings. The TRP theory provides simple guidelines for evaluating risky choices for individuals and organizational management.},

abstract = {Environmental risks constitute a special category of risks because they often involve consequences that are highly uncertain, strongly delayed, occurring at distant places, and—therefore—mostly borne by others. Economic, decision–theoretic, and psychological research about the way people deal with such consequences is reviewed. Two major findings are presented: first, there is evidence that discounting mechanisms are stable across different preference dimensions (uncertainty, temporal, spatial, and social distance). Second, discount rates tend to vary across different problem domains (e.g., environmental vs. health vs. financial risks). In particular, it appears that temporal discounting is less pronounced for environmental risks than in other domains. Several factors are identified that affect the nature of the risk evaluation process, and it is argued that environmental risks differ from other risks on such factors. These environmental-risk characteristics may have important implications for policy strategies to promote environmental sustainability. Contrary to other domains, appealing to the public's long-term preferences may be successful. Also in policy making, insights from standard economic decision theory to environmental decision making should be applied with caution.},

Our experiment shows that performing intentional acts of approach and avoidance in an evaluation task influences the unintended activation of approach and avoidance tendencies in another task in which stimulus valence is irrelevant. For the evaluation-relevant blocks, participants received either congruent (positive-approach, negative-avoidance) or incongruent (positive-avoidance, negative-approach) mapping instructions. In the evaluation-irrelevant blocks, approach- and avoidance-related lever movements were selected in response to a stimulus feature other than valence (affective Simon task). Response mapping in the evaluation task influenced performance in the evaluation-irrelevant task: An enhanced affective Simon effect was observed with congruent mapping instructions; in contrast, the effect was reversed when the evaluation task required incongruent responses. Thus, action instructions toward affective stimuli received in one task determined affective response tendencies in another task where these instructions were not in effect. These findings suggest that intentionally prepared short-term links between affective valence and motor responses elicit associated responses without a deliberate act of will, operating like a "prepared reflex."},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although most anesthesiologists will have 1 catastrophic perioperative event or more during their careers, there has been little research on their attitudes to assistive strategies after the event. There are wide-ranging emotional consequences for anesthesiologists involved in an unexpected intraoperative patient death, particularly if the anesthesiologist made an error. We used a between-groups survey study design to ask whether there are different attitudes to assistive strategies when a hypothetical patient death is caused by a drug error versus not caused by an error. First, we explored attitudes to generalized supportive strategies. Second, we examined our hypothesis that the presence of an error causing the hypothetical patient death would increase the perceived social stigma and self-stigma of help-seeking. Finally, we examined the strategies to assist help-seeking. METHODS An anonymous, mailed, self-administered survey was conducted with 1600 consultant anesthesiologists in Australia on the mailing list of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. The participants were randomized into "error" versus "no-error" groups for the hypothetical scenario of patient death due to anaphylaxis. Nonparametric, descriptive, parametric, and inferential tests were used for data analysis. P' is used where P values were corrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS There was a usable response rate of 48.9{\%}. When an error had caused the hypothetical patient death, participants were more likely to agree with 4 of the 5 statements about support, including need for time off (P' = 0.003), counseling (P' {\textless} 0.001), a formal strategy for assistance (P' {\textless} 0.001), and the anesthesiologist not performing further cases that day (P' = 0.047). There were no differences between groups in perceived self-stigma (P = 0.98) or social stigma (P = 0.15) of seeking counseling, whether or not an error had caused the hypothetical patient death. Finally, when an error had caused the patient death, participants were more likely to agree with 2 of the 5 statements about help-seeking, including the need for a formal, hospital-based process that provides information on where to obtain professional counseling (P' = 0.006) and the availability of after-hours counseling services (P' = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS Our participants were more likely to agree with assistive strategies such as not performing further work that day, time off, counseling, formal support strategies, and availability of after-hours counseling services, when the hypothetical patient death from anaphylaxis was due to an error. The perceived stigma toward attending counseling was not affected by the presence or absence of an error as the cause of the patient death, disproving our hypothesis.},

abstract = {Coordination is a taxonomy of how processes change together through time. It depicts the changes of two or more variables in terms of the strength and consistency of their covariation, the directionality of their covariation (i.e., do increases in one variable correspond with increases [in-phase] or decreases [anti-phase] in the other variable), and the timing of their covariation (i.e., do both variables change at the same rate or does one variable change faster than the other). Current methods are able to characterize some, but not all, of these aspects of coordination and provide incomplete information as a result. The current study addresses this limitation by demonstrating that multivariate latent change score models can be used to fully differentiate all possible coordination patterns. Furthermore, one can then expand coordination beyond the two outcome case to test arrangements of underlying coordination mechanisms or patterns. Examples using two simultaneous latent change score models and four simultaneous latent change score models illustrate this approach within the context of adolescents and parents regulating type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Research has consistently demonstrated that both individual-level climate perceptions and organizational climate are related to job satisfaction; however, little work has investigated their relative importance in a single study. Using a sample of 1,076 employees from 120 branches of a US-based bank, the relative importance of individual and unit-level climate on individual satisfaction was examined. Cross-level results of hierarchical linear models indicated that individuals' perceptions of the climate accounted for a large percentage of variance in individuals' satisfaction. Further, unit level climate systems accounted for a small but significant portion of individual satisfaction above and beyond individuals' perceptions of the climate. These results suggest that the overall climate in a work unit has some influence on individual attitudes, after accounting for individuals' idiosyncratic perceptions of the climate.

We present a set of hypotheses about the influence of the balanced scorecard approach on mental models and performance. A test based on a simulation experiment that uses a system dynamics model is performed. The experiment included three types of parameters: financial indicators; balanced scorecard indicators; and balanced scorecard indicators with the aid of a strategy map review. Two out of the three hypotheses were confirmed. It was concluded that a strategy map review positively influences mental model similarity, and mental model similarity positively influences performance.},

These theories are limited in their predictive accuracy in that they do not explain the probabilistic nature of preferential choice, that is, why an individual makes different choices in nearly identical situations, or why the magnitude of these inconsistencies varies in different situations. To illustrate the advantage of probabilistic theories, three probabilistic theories of decision making under risk are compared with their deterministic counterparts. The probabilistic theories are (a) a probabilistic version of a simple choice heuristic, (b) a probabilistic version of cumulative prospect theory, and (c) decision field theory. By testing the theories with the data from three experimental studies, the superiority of the probabilistic models over their deterministic counterparts in predicting people's decisions under risk become evident. When testing the probabilistic theories against each other, decision field theory provides the best account of the observed behavior.},

Among others in ecology, the medical sciences, personality measurement, educational science, sociology and political science circular data is collected. The most direct examples of circular data within the social sciences arise in cognitive and experimental psychology. However, despite numerous examples of circular data being collected in different areas of cognitive and experimental psychology, the knowledge of this type of data is not well-spread and literature in which these types of data are analysed using methods for circular data is relatively scarce. This paper therefore aims to give a tutorial in working with and analysing circular data to researchers in cognitive psychology and the social sciences in general. It will do so by focusing on data inspection, model fit, estimation and hypothesis testing for two specific models for circular data using packages from the statistical programming language R.},

In this paper, we provide an introduction to this method of data collection.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In order to make good decisions, individuals need to identify and properly integrate information about various attributes associated with a choice. Since choices are often complex and made rapidly, they are typically affected by contextual variables that are thought to influence how much attention is paid to different attributes. I propose a modification of the attentional drift-diffusion model, the binary-attribute attentional drift diffusion model (baDDM), which describes the choice process over simple binary-attribute choices and how it is affected by fluctuations in visual attention. Using an eye-tracking experiment, I find the baDDM makes accurate quantitative predictions about several key vari-ables including choices, reaction times, and how these variables are correlated with attention to two attributes in an accept-reject decision. Furthermore, I estimate an attribute-based fixation bias that sug-gests attention to an attribute increases its subjective weight by 5{\%}, while the unattended attribute's weight is decreased by 10{\%}.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Two influential approaches to modeling choice between risky options are algebraic models (which focus on predicting the overt decisions) and models of heuristics (which are also concerned with capturing the underlying cognitive process). Because they rest on funda-mentally different assumptions and algorithms, the two approaches are usually treated as antithetical, or even incommensurable. Drawing on cumulative prospect theory (CPT; Tversky {\&} Kahneman, 1992) as the currently most influential instance of a descriptive alge-braic model, we demonstrate how the two modeling traditions can be linked. CPT's alge-braic functions characterize choices in terms of psychophysical (diminishing sensitivity to probabilities and outcomes) as well as psychological (risk aversion and loss aversion) constructs. Models of heuristics characterize choices as rooted in simple information-processing principles such as lexicographic and limited search. In computer simulations, we estimated CPT's parameters for choices produced by various heuristics. The resulting CPT parameter profiles portray each of the choice-generating heuristics in psychologically meaningful ways—capturing, for instance, differences in how the heuristics process probability information. Furthermore, CPT parameters can reflect a key property of many heuristics, lexicographic search, and track the environment-dependent behavior of heuristics. Finally, we show, both in an empirical and a model recovery study, how CPT parameter profiles can be used to detect the operation of heuristics. We also address the limits of CPT's ability to capture choices produced by heuristics. Our results highlight an untapped potential of CPT as a measurement tool to characterize the information processing underlying risky choice.},

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provides a flexible and interpretable way of extending simple models of cognitive processes. To introduce this special issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories, including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure. We also highlight current models that already use the hierarchical Bayesian approach, as well as identifying research areas that could benefit from its adoption.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) The theory outlined in this chapter adopts a cognitive approach to motivation. It describes a research program premised on the notion that the cognitive treatment affords conceptual and methodological advantages enabling new insights into problems of motivated action, self-regulation, and self-control. The authors begin by placing their work in the broader historical context of social psychological theorizing about motivation and cognition. Then, they present their theoretical notion and trace their implications for a variety of psychological issues, including activity experience, goal commitment, choice, and substitution. The gist of this chapter describes the authors' empirical research concerning a broad range of phenomena informed by the goal-systemic analysis.

@article{Yildiz2017,
abstract = {Crew fatigue is one of the main causes of airline accidents. Regulatory authorities such as the Federal Aviation Agency constantly introduce new fatigue regulations, often in the form of hard constraints on the length of duty and rest periods. The complex nature of travel-related fatigue, however, makes it difficult to account for it indirectly through such constraints. Recent studies show that fatigue depends on human factors such as the homeostatic process and the circadian body clock as well as time-zone differences. In this work, we explicitly account for fatigue in crew pairing optimization through the Three Process Model of Alertness, one of the most comprehensive fatigue models available in the literature. We provide a mathematical model for the crew pairing problem that incorporates fatigue and solve it using a column generation approach. Numerical analysis on two real data sets reveals that the proposed approach is able to reduce the crew fatigue levels substantially with minimal impact on cost. In particular, it is shown that hard constraints on fatigue may still lead to high fatigue levels and that jet-lag and time-zone differences have a major impact. The results of the tests also show that some of the rules and regulations in practice may be omitted if the fatigue is accounted for directly.},

Participating in these efforts, psychologists and other social scientists have hypothesized that African Americans' continuing experiences with racism and discrimination may lie at the root of the many well-documented race-based physical health disparities that affect this population. With newly emerging methodologies in both measurement of contextual factors and functional neuroscience, an opportunity now exists to cleave together a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which discrimination has harmful effects on health. In this article, we review emerging work that locates the cause of race-based health disparities in the external effects of the contextual social space on the internal world of brain functioning and physiologic response. These approaches reflect the growing interdisciplinary nature of psychology in general, and the field of race relations in particular.},

Although the literature contains a vast collection of approximate functions for the normal distribution, they are very complicated, not very accurate, or valid for only a limited range. This paper proposes an enhanced approximate function. When comparing the proposed function to other approximations studied in the literature, it can be observed that the proposed logistic approximation has a simpler functional form and that it gives higher accuracy, with the maximum error of less than 0.00014 for the entire range. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the lowest level of error reported in the literature. The proposed logistic approximate function may be appealing to researchers, practitioners and educators given its functional simplicity and mathematical accuracy.},

abstract = {Objective: We examined the impact of prim- ing on operator trust and system performance when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles (UVs). Background: Advances in autonomy have enabled a future vision of single-operator control of multiple het- erogeneous UVs. Real-time scheduling for multiple UVs in uncertain environments requires the computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the judgment and adaptability of human supervisors. Because of system and environmental uncertainty, appropriate operator trust will be instrumental to maintain high system perfor- mance and prevent cognitive overload. Method: Three groups of operators experienced different levels of trust priming prior to conducting simulated missions in an existing, multiple-UV simula- tion environment. Results: Participants who play computer and video games frequently were found to have a higher propen- sity to overtrust automation. By priming gamers to lower their initial trust to a more appropriate level, system performance was improved by 10{\%} as com- pared to gamers who were primed to have higher trust in the automation. Conclusion: Priming was successful at adjusting the operator's initial and dynamic trust in the auto- mated scheduling algorithm, which had a substantial impact on system performance. Application: These results have important implica- tions for personnel selection and training for futuristic multi-UV systems under human supervision. Although gamers may bring valuable skills, they may also be potentially prone to automation bias. Priming during training and regular priming throughout missions may be one potential method for overcoming this propen- sity to overtrust automation. Keywords:},

They conclude that evaluating the likely quality of an intuitive judgment requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the individual's opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment. Subjective experience is not a reliable indicator of judgment accuracy.},

Participants (N = 131) completed a two-hour simulated multi-UAV mission assisted by an automated decision making aid of either high or low reliability. A decrease in subjective task engagement and performance over time marked the induction of passive fatigue by the mission. Participants were more trusting in the high reliability condition than in the low reliability condition. Finally, reliance decreased with time at any reliability, but a significant interaction between reliability and time on task indicated that the decrease was of smaller magnitude when the automation was reliable.},

One variable that has been consistently found to discriminate elite performers from their near-elite and novice counterparts is the Quiet Eye (QE). In the present paper, I first define the QE, followed by an explanation of its origins as well as the question: why have I pursued this one variable for over 35 years? I then provide a brief overview of QE research, and concentrate on QE training, which has emerged as an effective method for improving both attentional focus and motor performance. In the final section, I discuss some future directions, in particular those related to identifying the neural networks underlying the QE during successful trials.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {In multilevel modeling, one often distinguishes between macro-micro and micro-macro situations. In a macro-micro multilevel situation, a dependent variable measured at the lower level is predicted or explained by variables measured at that lower or a higher level. In a micro-macro multilevel situation, a dependent variable defined at the higher group level is predicted or explained on the basis of independent variables measured at the lower individual level. Up until now, multilevel methodology has mainly focused on macro-micro multilevel situations. In this article, a latent variable model is proposed for analyzing data from micro-macro situations. It is shown that regression analyses carried out at the aggregated level result in biased parameter estimates. A method that uses the best linear unbiased predictors of the group means is shown to yield unbiased estimates of the parameters.},

abstract = {In the extant organizational, management, and strategy literatures there are now frequent calls for microfoundations. However, there is little consensus on what micro- foundations are and what they are not. In this paper we first (briefly) review the history of the microfoundations discussion and then discuss what microfoundations are and are not. We highlight four misconceptions or “half-truths” about microfoundations: (1) that microfoundations are psychology, human resources, or micro-organizational be- havior, (2) that borrowed concepts constitute microfoundations, (3) that microfounda- tions lead to an infinite regress, and (4) that microfoundations deny the role of structure and institutions. We discuss both the partial truths and the misconceptions associated with the above understandings of microfoundations, and we argue that questions of social aggregation and emergence need to be center stage in any discussion of microfoundations. We link our arguments about microfoundations and aggregation with closely related calls for new areas of research, such as “behavioral strategy” and the domain of multilevel human capital research. We discuss various forms of social aggregation and also highlight associated opportunities for future research, with a specific focus on the origins of capabilities and competitive advantage.},

However, labor usually improves objects and increases their value, and it has not been investigated whether these considerations underlie people's use of the labor rule. We presented participants with third-party ownership conflicts between an owner of materials and an artist who used the materials for some artwork. Experiment 1 revealed that participants were more likely to transfer ownership to the artist for low-value materials than for high-value materials, and Experiment 2 showed that this effect was further moderated by the amount of effort the artist had invested. A third experiment confirmed that participants transferred ownership more often if the artist's labor had increased the value of the materials than when it had added no value. These findings suggest that considerations for value underlie ownership transfers following the investment of labor.},

abstract = {Argues that the revolution in psychology that cybernetics at one time seemed to promise has been delayed by 4 blunders: (a) dismissal of control theory as a mere machine analogy, (b) failure to describe control phenomena from the behaving system's point of view, (c) applying the general control system model with its signals and functions improperly identified, and (d) focusing on man–machine systems in which the "man" part is conventionally described. A general nonlinear quasi-static analysis of relationships between an organism and its environment shows that the classical stimulus–response, stimulus–orgamism–response, or antecedent–consequent analyses of behavioral organization are special cases, a far more likely case being a control system type of relationship. Even for intermittent interactions, the control system equations lead to one simple characterization: Control systems control what they sense, opposing disturbances as they accomplish this end. A series of progressively more complex experimental demonstrations of principle illustrates both phenomena and methodology in a control system approach to the quantitative analysis of purposive systems, that is, systems in which the governing principle is control of input.

abstract = {In many decision contexts, there is uncertainty in the assessed probabilities and expected consequences of different actions. The fundamental goal for information providers is to present uncertainty in a way that is not overly complicated, yet sufficiently detailed to prompt decision-makers to think about the implications of this uncertainty for the decision at hand. In two experiments, we assess the pros and cons of providing an evaluative structure to facilitate the comprehension and use of uncertainty information and explore whether people who vary in numeracy perceive and use uncertainty in different ways. Participants were presented with scenarios and summary tables describing the anticipated consequences of different environmental-management actions. Our results suggest that different uncertainty formats may lead people to think in particular ways. Laypeople had an easier time understanding the general concept of uncertainty when an evaluative label was presented (e.g. uncertainty is High or Low). However, when asked about a specific possible outcome for an attribute, participants performed better when presented with numerical ranges. Our results also suggest that there appear to be advantages to using evaluative labels, in that they can highlight aspects of uncertainty information that may otherwise be overlooked in more complex numerical displays. However, the salience of evaluative labels appeared to cause some participants to put undue weight on this information, which resulted in value-inconsistent choices. The simplicity and power of providing an evaluative structure is a double-edged sword.},

abstract = {A state-of-the-art data analysis procedure is pre-sented to conduct hierarchical Bayesian inference and hypothesis testing on delay discounting data. The delay dis-counting task is a key experimental paradigm used across a wide range of disciplines from economics, cognitive sci-ence, and neuroscience, all of which seek to understand how humans or animals trade off the immediacy verses the magnitude of a reward. Bayesian estimation allows rich inferences to be drawn, along with measures of confidence, based upon limited and noisy behavioural data. Hierarchi-cal modelling allows more precise inferences to be made, thus using sometimes expensive or difficult to obtain data in the most efficient way. The proposed probabilistic gener-ative model describes how participants compare the present subjective value of reward choices on a trial-to-trial basis, estimates participant-and group-level parameters. We infer discount rate as a function of reward size, allowing the magnitude effect to be measured. Demonstrations are pro-vided to show how this analysis approach can aid hypothesis testing. The analysis is demonstrated on data from the popular 27-item monetary choice questionnaire (Kirby, Psy-chonomic Bulletin {\&} Review, 16(3), 457–462 2009), but will accept data from a range of protocols, including adap-tive procedures.

abstract = {The paper surveys over twenty models of delay discounting (also known as temporal discounting, time preference, time discounting), that psychologists and economists have put forward to explain the way people actually trade off time and money. Using little more than the basic algebra of powers and logarithms, I show how the models are derived, what assumptions they are based upon, and how different models relate to each other. Rather than concentrate only on discount functions themselves, I show how discount functions may be manipulated to isolate rate parameters for each model. This approach, consistently applied, helps focus attention on the three main components in any discounting model: subjectively perceived money; subjectively perceived time; and how these elements are combined. We group models by the number of parameters that have to be estimated, which means our exposition follows a trajectory of increasing complexity to the models. However, as the story unfolds it becomes clear that most models fall into a smaller number of families. We also show how new models may be constructed by combining elements of different models. The surveyed models are: Exponential; Hyperbolic; Arithmetic; Hyperboloid (Green {\&} Myerson, Rachlin); Loewen-stein and Prelec Generalized Hyperboloid; quasi-Hyperbolic (also known as $\beta$-$\delta$ discounting); Benhabib et al's fixed cost; Benhabib et al's Exponential / Hyperbolic / quasi-Hyperbolic; Read's discounting fractions; Roelofsma's exponen-tial time; Scholten and Read's discounting-by-intervals (DBI); Ebert and Prelec's constant sensitivity (CS); Bleichrodt et al.'s constant absolute decreasing impatience (CADI); Bleichrodt et al.'s constant relative decreasing impatience (CRDI); Green, Myerson, and Macaux's hyperboloid over intervals models; Killeen's additive utility; size-sensitive additive util-ity; Yi, Landes, and Bickel's memory trace models; McClure et al.'s two exponentials; and Scholten and Read's trade-off model. For a convenient overview, a single " cheat sheet " table captures the notation and essential mathematics behind all but one of the models.},

Here, we illustrate how such methods can lead to a much more detailed understanding of group differences than bar graphs and t-tests on means. To complement the neuroscientist's toolbox, we present two powerful tools that can help us understand how groups of observations differ: the shift function and the difference asymmetry function. These tools can be combined with detailed visualisations to provide complementary perspectives about the data. We provide implementations in R and MATLAB of the graphical tools, and all the examples in the article can be reproduced using R scripts.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: Historically, mathematical models of human neurobehavioral performance developed on data from one sleep study were limited to predicting performance in similar studies, restricting their practical utility. We recently developed a unified model of performance (UMP) to predict the effects of the continuum of sleep loss—from chronic sleep restriction (CSR) to total sleep deprivation (TSD) challenges—and validated it using data from two studies of one laboratory. Here, we significantly extended this effort by validating the UMP predictions across a wide range of sleep/wake schedules from different studies and laboratories. Methods: We developed the UMP on psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) lapse data from one study encompassing four different CSR conditions (7 d of 3, 5, 7, and 9 h of sleep/night), and predicted performance in five other studies (from four laboratories), including different combinations of TSD (40 to 88 h), CSR (2 to 6 h of sleep/night), control (8 to 10 h of sleep/night), and nap (nocturnal and diurnal) schedules. Results: The UMP accurately predicted PVT performance trends across 14 different sleep/wake conditions, yielding average prediction errors between 7{\%} and 36{\%}, with the predictions lying within 2 standard errors of the measured data 87{\%} of the time. In addition, the UMP accurately predicted performance impairment (average error of 15{\%}) for schedules (TSD and naps) not used in model development. Conclusions: The unified model of performance can be used as a tool to help design sleep/wake schedules to optimize the extent and duration of neurobehavioral performance and to accelerate recovery after sleep loss.

abstract = {Humans move their eyes to gather information about the visual world. However, saccadic sampling has largely been explored in paradigms that involve searching for a lone target in a cluttered array or natural scene. Here, we investigated the policy that humans use to overtly sample information in a perceptual decision task that required information from across multiple spatial locations to be combined. Participants viewed a spatial array of numbers and judged whether the average was greater or smaller than a reference value. Partici-pants preferentially sampled items that were less diagnostic of the correct answer (" inlying " elements; that is, elements closer to the reference value). This preference to sample inlying items was linked to decisions, enhancing the tendency to give more weight to inlying elements in the final choice (" robust averaging "). These findings con-trast with a large body of evidence indicating that gaze is directed preferentially to deviant information during natural scene viewing and visual search, and suggest that humans may sample information " robustly " with their eyes during perceptual decision-making. decision-making | categorization | eye movements | numerical averaging | information sampling A well-validated computational framework argues that deci-sions are made by integrating information toward a threshold, at which point a response is made (1, 2). Within this integration-to-bound framework, decisions are optimized by sequential sampling, at the cost of delaying responding (3). Studies using this framework in conjunction with psychophysical tasks have suggested that hu-mans and monkeys make approximately optimal perceptual cate-gory judgments, with choice accuracy limited mainly by sensory noise or uncertainty in the external world (2, 4, 5). These psycho-physical studies have been argued to offer a window on the general mechanisms by which humans make decisions (6). However, paradigms in which stimulation is continuously available and controlled exclusively by the experimenter differ from everyday choices in real-world environments. For example, in the random dot motion (RDM) paradigm, subjects passively sample from a single, continuous, centrally presented stream of information and decide whether average dot motion tends in one direction or another (7). By contrast, decisions about the average feature in a natural scene are made by actively saccading (or covertly attending) to successive im-age locations and sampling the subset of information that is available there. For example, a foraging monkey might move its eyes freely to several locations in the forest canopy and average the available fruit yield to decide where to move. Real-world category decisions, thus, are affected not only by the quality of the sensory information and the dynamics of integration, but also by the policy that dictates how information is sampled and weighted when forming a decision. However, the nature of this policy remains largely unknown. The determinants of saccadic eye movements have been ex-tensively investigated during visual search (8) and natural scene perception (9). In visual search tasks, eye movements are attracted to image locations that contain perceptually salient or surprising items (10, 11) or to those points at which task-relevant information is maximal (12–15). In value-based choice tasks, in which for example participants judge which of two or more food items is preferred, choices and eye movements are interlinked, in that items that are fixated more frequently are chosen more often (16, 17). Other models have suggested that more uncertain sources are sampled more thoroughly with the eyes (18) or that decisions and information-gathering mutually drive one another in a reciprocal cascade (19). However, little is known about the policy by which participants sample information during choice tasks that involve integrating decision information from multiple locations across the visual field. Various studies have investigated the sampling policy in differing domains, such as category learning (20) and classification tasks (21). Recently, researchers have highlighted the importance of investigating evidence accumulation as an ac-tive sampling process (22). We investigated this sampling process by measuring eye movements while human participants performed a categorization task that involved averaging numbers in a spatial array. We used fully visible symbolic numbers as stimuli, allowing us to assess how gaze placement was determined by the statistics of decision information, rather than the perceptual arrangement of the stimulus array. When averaging perceptual features across multiple locations under central fixation, participants tend to downweight or ignore extreme values, such as a deviant expression in a crowd of faces (23) or outlying color values in an array of shapes (24). This has led to the proposal that " inlying " items (those that are closer to the category boundary) are processed with higher gain than outliers (24, 25). However, a related possibility is that observers tend to sample by preference those items that are closer to the category boundary. Testing this theory, we found humans prefer to fixate the inlying items in a stimulus array during a perceptual decision-making task—a policy that contradicts the well-estab-lished preference for fixating deviant items in visual search tasks.},

abstract = {A performance metric and goal-setting procedure is defined for an order fulfillment operation. In this operation, order requests arrive continuously, and filled orders are shipped at a specific time each day. The metric links the continuous operation of order fulfillment to the scheduled shipment times. To prescribe goals against the metric, a performance model is developed that incorporates the motivational effect of a goal. Goal-Setting Theory is used to establish the performance goal and to show how to match arriving orders to deadlines based on their arrival times and expected processing times. Monte Carlo simulation on data from a large distribution center is used to demonstrate that setting these two parameters in the light of motivational research yields quite different results than doing so with an intuitive method. Moreover, a motivational goal leads to better operational performance; that is, correctly setting up the metric causes more customers to receive their orders sooner. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Individuals have different concerns before and after they become relatively certain about a goal's attainability; hence, we propose that the presence of alternative means of goal attainment will have a distinctive impact on motivation, depending on their stage of goal pursuit. In the initial stage of goal pursuit, people are concerned about whether the goal is attainable. The presence of multiple attainment means (vs. a single means) makes the goal seem more easily attainable and thus leads to greater motivation. Conversely, when people have made substantial progress on the goal and its attainment is relatively secured, they focus more on how they can race to the end and complete the pursuit. At these times, a single means (vs. multiple means) provides a more straightforward action plan and in turn leads to greater motivation. Two field studies and 3 lab experiments support this theorizing.},

In the context of ordinary significance-testing analysis, optional stopping is discour-aged, because it necessarily leads to increased type I error rates over nominal values. This article addresses whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian inference with Bayes factors. Statisticians who developed Bayesian methods thought not, but this wisdom has been challenged by recent simulation results of Yu, Sprenger, Thomas, and Dougherty (2013) and Sanborn and Hills (2013). In this article, I show through simulation that the interpretation of Bayesian quanti-ties does not depend on the stopping rule. Researchers using Bayesian methods may employ optional stopping in their own research and may provide Bayesian analysis of secondary data regardless of the employed stopping rule. I emphasize here the proper interpretation of Bayesian quantities as measures of subjective belief on theoretical positions, the difference be-tween frequentist and Bayesian interpretations, and the diffi-culty of using frequentist intuition to conceptualize the Bayesian approach.},

abstract = {The motivation of this paper is to model and predict the evolution of preferences over time. Literature suggests that preferences, as denoted by taste parameters and consideration sets in the context of utility-maximizing behavior, may evolve over time in response to changes in demographic and situational variables, psychological, sociological and biological constructs, and available alternatives and their attributes. However, existing representations typically overlook the influence of past experiences on present preferences. This study develops, applies and tests a hidden Markov model with a discrete choice kernel to model and forecast the evolution of individual preferences and behaviors over long-range forecasting horizons. The hidden states denote different preferences i.e. modes considered in the choice set, and sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. The evolutionary path of those hidden states (preference states) is hypothesized to be a first-order Markov process such that an individual's preferences during a particular time period are dependent on their preferences during the previous time period. The framework is applied to study the evolution of travel mode preferences, or modality styles, over time, in response to a major change in the public transportation system. We use longitudinal travel diary from Santiago, Chile. The dataset consists of four one-week pseudo travel diaries collected before and after the introduction of Transantiago, a complete redesign of the public transportation system in the city. Our model identifies four modality styles in the population, labeled as follows: drivers, bus users, bus-metro users, and auto-metro users. The modality styles differ in terms of the travel modes that they consider and their sensitivity to level-of-service attributes (travel time, travel cost, etc.). At the population level, there are significant shifts in the distribution of individuals across modality styles before and after the change in the system, but the distribution is relatively stable in the periods after the change. In general, the proportion of drivers, auto-metro users, and bus-metro users has increased, and the proportion of bus users has decreased. At the individual level, habit formation is found to impact transition probabilities across all modality styles: individuals are more likely to stay in the same modality style over successive time periods than transition to a different modality style. Finally, a comparison between the proposed dynamic framework and comparable static frameworks reveals differences in aggregate forecasts for different policy scenarios, demonstrating the value of the proposed framework for both individual and population-level policy analysis.},

abstract = {The practical significance of Locke's theory of goal setting was assessed using a time series design. Data on the net weight of 36 logging trucks in six logging operations were collected for 12 consecutive months. Performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific hard goal. Company cost accounting procedures indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. Locke's (1968) theory of goal setting has been questioned with regard to its generality to industry (Campbell, Dunnette, Lawler, {\&} Weick, 1970; Heneman {\&} Schwab, 1972). Survey data collected from 292 independent Southern pulp-wood producers, however, have shown that goal setting accompanied by the presence of supervision results in high productivity and a low number of injuries (Ronan, Latham, {\&} Kinne, 1973). The results regarding productivity were corroborated through an analysis of variance of data collected from 892 additional producers. Latham and Kinne (1974) experimentally assessed the effects of a one-day training program on goal setting over 12 consecutive weeks. The results showed that independent producers who set a specific production goal for their crew had higher productivity and lower absenteeism than those who were matched and randomly assigned to a control "do your best" condition. These studies would appear to support the external validity of goal setting from a statistical standpoint. Statistical significance, however, is only one step in probing the external validity of a theory. The crucial consideration is whether or not the application of the theory changes behavior enough to make a difference to an organiza-tion's objectives (Campbell et al, 1970). The purpose of the present article is to describe a time series design that assessed the utility or "practical significance" of Locke's theory on the performance of company logging trucks. 3 The 1 The authors are grateful to E. A. Locke, T. M. Mitchell, and G. A. Yukl for their suggestions in preparing this manuscript. 2 Requests for reprints should be sent to G. P. Latham, Manager and Staff Psychologist, Human Resource Research, Weyerhaeuser Company, Tacoma, Washington 98401. 3 The two previous studies of independent wood producers were conducted under the auspices of the American Pulpwood Association Harvesting Research problem investigated was that of increasing the net weight of trucks that transport logs from the woods to the mill. Normally, it takes 60-120 logs/trees for a truck to carry its maximum legal load. Because each tree differs in length and in diameter, it is a matter of judgment as to how many and what type should be carried in a given load. The hypothesis tested was that the effects of goal setting would appear in the form of an increase in the slope or level of the performance curve, as compared to the baseline performance. Further, it was hypothesized that performance improvement would be evident after the first month of goal setting. This hypothesis was based on the earlier finding by Latham and Kinne (1974) that the effects of goal setting were immediate and consistent over time. METHOD Subjects Six company logging operations in Oklahoma were studied. Each operation consisted of 6 to 10 people who performed one of the following operations: (a) falling a tree; (fc) dragging the tree to a landing; (c) loading the tree into a truck; or (d) driving the truck to the mill where it is weighed and unloaded. There were approximately 6 trucks and 6 drivers assigned to each logging operation. The truck drivers differed from previous woods workers who had been studied (Latham {\&} Kinne, 1974; Ronan et al., 1973) in that they were paid by the hour as opposed to piecerate, they were company employees as opposed to independent entrepreneurs, and they were members of a union. Data were collected on the net weights of 36 trucks. This number represented all the company's logging trucks in this Project. Association policy, coupled with the fact that these producers were noncompany employees, prevented the collection of data concerning profits. 122},

Studies of choice between risky prospects have suggested a nonlinear transformation of the probability scale that overweights low probabilities and underweights moderate and high probabilities. The present article extends this notion from risk to uncertainty by invoking the principle of bounded subadditivity: An event has greater impact when it turns impossibility into possibility, or possibility into certainty, than when it merely makes a possibility more or less likely. A series of studies provides support for this principle in decision under both risk and uncertainty and shows that people are less sensitive to uncertainty than to risk.

abstract = {The feature-matching comparison process was used to examine prechoice conflict and postchoice feelings of satisfaction. In Experiment 1, subjects chose between paired items that either shared good features and had unique bad features (unique bad paris) or shared bad features and had unique good features (unique good pairs). Unique bad pairs should produce avoidance-avoidance conflicts, with vacillation between the alternatives and the slow decisions. Unique good pairs should produce approach-approach conflicts, with little vacillation and rapid decisions. As predicted, decision times were longer for unique bad pairs. Experiment 2 examined subjects' satisfaction with a choice between items that constituted either a unique good or a unique bad pair. It was expected that postchoice satisfaction would depend upon the interaction of the valence of the unique features and which alternative (the accepted or the rejected) was the focus at the time satisfaction was assessed. For unique good pairs, satisfaction was greater when the focus was on the accepted alternative. For unique bad pairs, satisfaction was greater when the focus was on the rejected alternative. The results are used to provide a theoretical rationale for predicting and understanding both predecisional and postdecisional outcomes. These results are discussed in terms of the relevance of the comparison process for different phases of the choice situation and the relations between pre- and postchoice phenomena.},

abstract = {Explaining group-level outcomes from individual-level predictors requires aggregating the individual-level scores to the group level and correcting the group-level estimates for measurement errors in the aggregated scores. However, for discrete variables it is not clear how to perform the aggregation and correction. It is shown how stepwise latent class analysis can be used to do this. First, a latent class model is estimated in which the scores on a discrete individual-level predictor are used to construct group-level latent classes. Second, this latent class model is used to aggregate the individual-level predictor by assigning the groups to the latent classes. Third, a group-level analysis is performed in which the aggregated measures are related to the remaining group-level variables while correcting for the measurement error in the class assignments. This stepwise approach is introduced in a multilevel mediation model with a single individual-level mediator, and compared to existing methods in a simulation study. We also show how a mediation model with multiple group-level latent variables can be used with multiple individual-level mediators and this model is applied to explain team productivity (group level) as a function of job control (individual level), job satisfaction (individual level), and enriched job design (group level).},

Given the complexity of the processes involved in goal pursuit, DLPFC is likely part of a network that includes orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), cingulate, amygdala, and basal ganglia. This hypothesis was tested with regard to one component of goal pursuit, the maintenance of goals in the face of distraction. Examination of connectivity with motivation-related areas of DLPFC supported the network hypothesis. Differential patterns of connectivity suggest a distinct role for DLPFC areas, with one involved in selecting approach goals, one in selecting avoidance goals, and one in selecting goal pursuit strategies. Finally, differences in trait motivation moderated connectivity between DLPFC and OFC, suggesting that this connectivity is important for instantiating motivation.},

In each set, subjects indicated their preferences for outcomes of objectively equal value that differed only in the amount of expected time delay before their occurrence. As predicted, as the anticipated delay interval for attainment of a reward increased, the subjective value of the reward decreased for both children and adults. In contrast, the length of anticipated delay time did not affect the sub- jective value of punishments. Any anticipated delay, however, regardless of duration, consistently did affect the aversiveness of punishments for adults, but not for children. Adults preferred immediate punishments to more delayed ones, regardless of specific time intervals; children's evaluations of punishments were not influenced systematically by any future temporal considerations.

abstract = {The unrealistically high rate of positive results within psychology has increased the attention to replication research. However, researchers who conduct a replication and want to statistically combine the results of their replication with a statistically significant original study encounter problems when using traditional meta-analysis techniques. The original study's effect size is most probably overestimated because it is statistically significant, and this bias is not taken into consideration in traditional meta-analysis. We have developed a hybrid method that does take the statistical significance of an original study into account and enables (a) accurate effect size estimation, (b) estimation of a confidence interval, and (c) testing of the null hypothesis of no effect. We analytically approximate the performance of the hybrid method and describe its statistical properties. By applying the hybrid method to data from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we demonstrate that the conclusions based on the hybrid method are often in line with those of the replica-tion, suggesting that many published psychological studies have smaller effect sizes than those reported in the original study, and that some effects may even be absent. We offer hands-on guidelines for how to statistically combine an original study and replication, and have developed a Web-based application (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/hybrid) for applying the hybrid method.},

These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts.

abstract = {Material punishment has been suggested to play a key role in sustaining human cooperation. Experimental findings, however, show that inflicting mere material costs does not always increase cooperation and may even have detrimental effects. Indeed, ethnographic evidence suggests that the most typical punishing strategies in human ecologies (e.g., gossip, derision, blame and criticism) naturally combine normative information with material punishment. Using laboratory experiments with humans, we show that the interaction of norm communication and material punishment leads to higher and more stable cooperation at a lower cost for the group than when used separately. In this work, we argue and provide experimental evidence that successful human cooperation is the outcome of the interaction between instrumental decision-making and the norm psychology humans are provided with. Norm psychology is a cognitive machinery to detect and reason upon norms that is characterized by a salience mechanism devoted to track how much a norm is prominent within a group. We test our hypothesis both in the laboratory and with an agent-based model. The agent-based model incorporates fundamental aspects of norm psychology absent from previous work. The combination of these methods allows us to provide an explanation for the proximate mechanisms behind the observed cooperative behaviour. The consistency between the two sources of data supports our hypothesis that cooperation is a product of norm psychology solicited by norm-signalling and coercive devices.},

We show that this measure does not provide a reliable way to gauge complexity, which prevents model flexibility analysis from fulfilling either of the 2 aims outlined by Veksler et al.

We advocate for the use of well-established techniques with these characteristics, such as Bayes factors, normalized maximum likelihood, or cross-validation, and against the use of model flexibility analysis. In the discussion, we explore 2 issues relevant to the area of model evaluation: the completeness of current model selection methods and the philosophical debate of absolute versus relative model evaluation.},

abstract = {A general theory of measurement context effects, called Hilbert space multidimensional (HSM) theory, is presented. A measurement context refers to a subset of psychological variables that an individual evaluates on a particular occasion. Different contexts are formed by evaluating different but possibly overlapping subsets of variables. Context effects occur when the judgments across contexts cannot be derived from a single joint probability distribution over the complete set of values of the observed variables. HSM theory provides a way to model these context effects by using quantum probability theory, which represents all the variables within a low dimensional vector space. HSM models produce parameter estimates that provide a simple and informative interpretation of the complex collection of judgments across contexts. Comparisons of HSM model fits with Bayesian network model fits are reported for a new large experiment, demonstrating the viability of this new model. We conclude that the theory is broadly applicable to measurement context effects found in the social and behavioral sciences. This article presents a general theory for predicting and understanding the effects that measurement contexts have on human judgments. A measurement context refers to a set of psychological variables or attributes that an individual is required to evaluate on a particular occasion (Dzhafarov {\&} Kujala, 2016). Different contexts are formed by evaluating different but possibly overlapping subsets of variables. A measurement context effect occurs when the judgments about the variables or attributes are affected by the measurement context in which they appear (Bruza, 2016). This can happen when the interpretation or meaning of some attributes change across measurement contexts (see, e.g., Schwarz {\&} Sud-man, 2012). Context effects raise problems for multivariate analysis because traditional approaches rely on the use of a single joint probability space based on the observed variables, which turns out to be invalid when context effects are present. We propose an approach to analyzing different measurement contexts based on quantum probability theory, which was originally developed to account for variables that have contextual dependencies. The article is organized as follows. First, we provide a more precise definition of context effects after considering an illustrative example. Second, we empirically review context effects reported previously in the literature. Third, we introduce the general principles of quantum probability theory as well as the justification for adopting these principles. Fourth, we present the steps for building a Hilbert space multidimensional model of measurement context effects. Fifth, we present an example application with a new large empirical data set. Last, we present a summary and describe possible extensions of the theory.},

abstract = {According to artificial intelligence studies, goal-based and utility-based agents can select an action to attain a desired outcome. The goal-based agent sets a specific goal regardless of its utility at first, and selects the action that leads to that goal (goal-based action selection). The utility-based agent compares the utilities of different possible outcomes, and selects the action that causes the outcome with the highest utility (utility-based action bias). The medial prefrontal cortex is involved in implementing the goal-based action selection and the striatum is involved in implementing the utility-based action bias. Goal-based action selection may be temporarily dominant over the utility-based action bias in a new environment, whereas the utility-based action bias becomes dominant after acquisition of action utilities in the environment. This transition of dominance between the two decision systems may be enhanced by a reference-point shift based on the goal-setting process during goal-based action selection.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that people make intertemporal choices by "discounting" the value of delayed outcomes, assigning discounted values independently to all options, and comparing the discounted values. We identify a class of anomalies to this assumption of alternative-based discounting, which collectively shows that options are not treated independently but rather comparatively: The time difference, or interval, between the options sometimes counts more and sometimes counts less if it is taken as a whole than if it is divided into shorter subintervals (superadditivity and subadditivity, respectively), and whether the interval counts more or less depends on the money difference, or compensation, involved (inseparability). We develop a model that replaces alternative-based discounting with attribute-based tradeoffs. In our model, people make intertemporal choices by weighing how much more they will receive or pay if they wait longer against how much longer the wait will be, or, conversely, how much less they will receive or pay if they do not wait longer against how much shorter the wait will be. This model, called the tradeoff model, accommodates, in a psychologically plausible way, all anomalies that the discounting approach can and cannot address.},

The study was conducted in a 2 (social observation: no vs. yes)x2 (task difficulty: easy vs. difficult) between-persons design. In accordance with engagement-related predictions about the role of social observation in active coping, the mere presence of an experimenter who observed participants during task performance increased the reactivity of systolic blood pressure when the task was difficult, but not when the task was easy. Without social observation, reactivity was modest in both the easy and the difficult conditions. Reactivity of diastolic blood pressure described the same pattern as systolic blood pressure. Results are interpreted as evidence for an effort-related analysis of cardiovascular reactivity based on the principles of motivational intensity theory.},

Trend analyses revealed that the functions relating choice time to the number of choice alternatives in a set and the number of attributes comprising those alternatives contained linear (increasing) components. In addition, for a portion of the subjects, there was a quadratic effect of the number of attributes available to the decision maker on choice time, suggesting that these subjects adopted simplification strategies at high levels of task complexity. Reliable individual differences in these trend components were observed, consistent with individual differences in motivation and/or processing capacities. These individual differences were included in an information-processing model of decision behavior that captured the choice time data observed in this study. Subjects' ratings of apartments were used as a basis to assess the extent to which the use of simplification strategies resulted in preference reversals. Contrary to expectation, subjects whose choice times contained quadratic components demonstrated fewer preference reversals at high levels of information load.},

Yet these models rarely take into account the motivating effects of goals, which may lead to departures from objective reward maximizing behavior. We present an experiment in which people make a series of prioritiza-tion decisions whilst pursuing two approach or avoidance goals. Participants were rewarded {\$}10 if they achieved both goals on a randomly selected trial, and either {\$}0, {\$}2.50, {\$}5, {\$}7.50, or {\$}10 if they achieved only one. Bayesian parameter estimation was used to examine the subjective values that people placed on various goal achievement outcomes. The results suggested that people often discounted the achieve-ment of the first goal, relative to a reward maximizing model, particularly when pursuing avoidance goals. These results were most evident among participants who could obtain the full reward after achieving just one goal, yet behaved as if achieving one goal was only half as valuable as achieving both. Our findings question the notion that peo-ple put forth the least amount of effort required to obtain a reward. They suggest that when tasks have explicit goals, people may even sacrifice financial reward to achieve the goals.},

What is less clear to the authors is the degree to which this excitement is justified. Like many psychology researchers, we were initially unfamiliar with the concepts, terminology, and techniques used in DST modeling (an approach that was developed in physics), which made it difficult to judge applications of DST in the articles we encountered. After reading introductory DST material, we developed some opinions about how authors of DST-related articles could help psychologists who are not familiar with DST [hereafter referred to as “lay reader(s)”] to begin to make judgments about their work. In order for DST to be a useful methodology for psychology research, we believe, DST-based work must be reasonably accessible to other psychologists. Although we are restricting our discussion to the application of DST methodology to clinical psychology research, we believe that the following three recommendations may be applied to the field of psychology more broadly.},

Furthermore, the rate at which this effect strengthened was faster for individuals with high-ability or low-performance orientation. There was also an interaction between learning and performance orientations that only emerged after practice.

abstract = {Many organizations are blurring the boundaries between work and nonwork through practices such as flextime, telecommuting, and on-site day-cares. Such integration of work and nonwork is purported to help employees find the seemingly elusive ‘‘work-life balance.'' Scholarly investigations of this issue have increased in number, but a standard measure of work–nonwork boundary strength has yet to emerge. The purpose of this research is to explore the boundary strength construct through the process of measure validation. In Study 1, data were collected from students (N¼162) to pilot test the measure. Study 2 was a longitudinal field study in which data were collected from employees of Canadian organizations (Survey 1: N¼793; Matched data for Surveys 1 {\&} 2: N¼205). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesized two-factor structure of the work–nonwork boundary strength measure, con- firming the importance of differentiating boundary strength at home (BSH) and boundary strength at work (BSW). Longitudinal analyses confirmed the structural invariance of the measure and revealed that boundary strengths are relatively stable over a period of 1 year. Role identification was related to boundary strength at home only.Weak boundaries, both at home and at work, were associated with high inter-role conflict.

abstract = {Cognitive models aim to explain complex human behavior in terms of hypothesized mechanisms of the mind. These mechanisms can be formalized in terms of mathematical structures containing parameters that are theoretically meaningful. For example, in the case of perceptual decision making, model parameters might correspond to theoretical constructs like response bias, evidence quality, response caution, and the like. Formal cognitive models go beyond verbal models in that cognitive mechanisms are instantiated in terms of mathematics and they go beyond statistical models in that cognitive model parameters are psychologically interpretable. We explore three key elements used to formally evaluate cognitive models: parameter estimation, model prediction, and model selection. We compare and contrast traditional approaches with Bayesian statistical approaches to performing each of these three elements. Traditional approaches rely on an array of seemingly ad hoc techniques, whereas Bayesian statistical approaches rely on a single, principled, internally consistent system. We illustrate the Bayesian statistical approach to evaluating cognitive models using a running example of the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model of decision making (Brown SD, Heathcote A. The simplest complete model of choice response time: linear ballistic accumulation. Cogn Psychol 2008, 57:153-178).

abstract = {The ubiquity of psychological process models requires an increased degree of sophistication in the methods and metrics that we use to evaluate them. We contribute to this venture by capitalizing on recent work in cognitive science analyzing response dynamics, which shows that the bearing information processing dynamics have on intended action is also revealed in the motor system. This decidedly "embodied" view suggests that researchers are missing out on potential dependent variables with which to evaluate their models-those associated with the motor response that produces a choice. The current work develops a method for collecting and analyzing such data in the domain of decision making. We first validate this method using widely normed stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (Experiment 1), and demonstrate that curvature in response trajectories provides a metric of the competition between choice options. We next extend the method to risky decision making (Experiment 2) and develop predictions for three popular classes of process model. The data provided by response dynamics demonstrate that choices contrary to the maxim of risk seeking in losses and risk aversion in gains may be the product of at least one "online" preference reversal, and can thus begin to discriminate amongst the candidate models. Finally, we incorporate attentional data collected via eye-tracking (Experiment 3) to develop a formal computational model of joint information sampling and preference accumulation. In sum, we validate response dynamics for use in preferential choice tasks and demonstrate the unique conclusions afforded by response dynamics over and above traditional methods. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

To demonstrate the respective strengths and weaknesses of the 2 approaches in representing these 2 aspects, we simulated data under (a) a cross-sectional common factor model, (b) a latent difference score model with random effects in intercept and slope, and (c) a bivariate dynamic factor analysis model with auto-and cross-regression parameters.

My algorithms are always at least as fast as relative value iteration and relative policy iteration, and are faster when the endogenous variables converge to their stationary distributions faster than the exogenous variables.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between type 2 diabetes and cancer. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia may lead to cancer through insulin's effect on its cognate receptor and the insulin-like growth factor system. The effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I on cancer development and progression have been demonstrated in animal and human studies. Type 2 diabetes has been positively associated with cancers of the breast, colon, and pancreas. An inverse relationship has been observed between type 2 diabetes and prostate cancer, and this may be due to lower testosterone levels in men with type 2 diabetes. Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes may affect cancer cells directly or indirectly by affecting serum insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia may be an important risk factor for cancer as well as a target for cancer therapy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Mount Sinai School of Medicine.},

abstract = {This study examined the application of the MML-EM algorithm to the parameter estimation problems of the normal ogive and logistic polytomous response models for Likert-type items. A rating-scale model was devel oped based on Samejima's (1969) graded response model. The graded response model includes a separate slope parameter for each item and an item response parameter. In the rating-scale model, the item re sponse parameter is resolved into two parameters: the item location parameter, and the category threshold parameter characterizing the boundary between re sponse categories. For a Likert-type questionnaire, where a single scale is employed to elicit different re sponses to the items, this item response model is ex pected to be more useful for analysis because the item parameters can be estimated separately from the threshold parameters associated with the points on a single Likert scale. The advantages of this type of model are shown by analyzing simulated data and data from the General Social Surveys.

abstract = {Human operators supervising multiple uninhabited air and ground vehicles (UAVs and UGVs) under high task load must be supported appropriately in context by automation. Two experiments examined the efficacy of such adaptive automation in a simulated high workload reconnaissance mission involving four subtasks: (a) UAV target identification; (b) UGV route planning; (c) communications, with embedded verbal situation awareness probes; and (d) change detection. The results of the first “baseline” experiment established the sensitivity of a change detection procedure to transient and nontransient events in a complex, multi-window, dynamic display. Experiment 1 also set appropriate levels of low and high task load for use in Experiment 2, in which three automation conditions were compared: manual; static automation, in which an automated target recognition (ATR) system was provided for the UAV task; and adaptive automation, in which individual operator change detection performance was assessed in real time and used to invoke the ATR if and only if change detection accuracy was below a threshold. Change detection accuracy and situation awareness were higher and workload was lower for both automation conditions compared to manual performance. In addition, these beneficial effects on change detection and workload were significantly greater for adaptive compared to static automation. The results point to the efficacy of adaptive automation for supporting the human operator tasked with supervision of multiple uninhabited vehicles under high workload conditions.},

The lack of research is surprising considering the increased use and the envisioned future use of UUVs in military maritime operations. In this paper, it is argued that because the underwater environment is so harsh and challenging, operating UUVs presents human factors problems that are different from the challenges of surface unmanned systems. Several common human factors problems are discussed when using unmanned systems, including the loss of sensory cues and spatial awareness, the control of the remote vehicle, problems with situation awareness and workload, and problems with trust in automation. In each case, these issues are discussed with respect to underwater operations. Crown Copyright.},

We extend these efforts to test psychologically more plausible models (i.e., strategies), including a new, probabilistic version of the take-the-best (TTB) heuristic that implements a rank order of error probabilities based on sequential processing. Within a coherent statistical framework, deterministic and probabilistic versions of TTB and other strategies can directly be compared using model selection by minimum description length or the Bayes factor. In an experiment with inferences from given information, only three of 104 participants were best described by the psychologically plausible, probabilistic version of TTB. Similar as in previous studies, most participants were classified as users of weighted-additive, a strategy that integrates all available information and approximates rational decisions.},

However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two em-pirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N = 204 (N = 32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N = 176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and $\Omega$nyx).},

Results revealed that all 3 factors had a significant influence on self-regulation, with goal content exhibiting the greatest influence.

abstract = {ISSN: 0027-3171 (Print) 1532-7906 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/hmbr20 ABSTRACT Latent change score models (LCS) are conceptually powerful tools for analyzing longitudinal data (McArdle {\&} Hamagami, 2001). However, applications of these models typically include constraints on key parameters over time. Although practically useful, strict invariance over time in these parameters is unlikely in real data. This study investigates the robustness of LCS when invariance over time is incorrectly imposed on key change-related parameters. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to explore the impact of misspecification on parameter estimation, predicted trajectories of change, and model fit in the dual change score model, the foundational LCS. When constraints were incorrectly applied, several parameters, most notably the slope (i.e., constant change) factor mean and autoproportion coefficient, were severely and consistently biased, as were regression paths to the slope factor when external predictors of change were included. Standard fit indices indicated that the misspecified models fit well, partly because mean level trajectories over time were accurately captured. Loosening constraint improved the accuracy of parameter estimates, but estimates were more unstable, and models frequently failed to converge. Results suggest that potentially common sources of misspecification in LCS can produce distorted impressions of developmental processes, and that identifying and rectifying the situation is a challenge.},

abstract = {When multiple pieces of information bear on a decision, the best approach is to combine the evidence provided by each one. Evidence integration models formalize the computations underlying this process, explain human perceptual discrimination behavior, and correspond to neuronal responses elicited by discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that evidence integration is key to understanding the neural basis of decision-making. Evidence integration has most often been studied with simple tasks that limit the timescale of deliberation to hundreds of milliseconds, but many natural decisions unfold over much longer durations. Because neural network models imply acute limitations on the timescale of evidence integration, it is unknown whether current computational insights can generalize beyond rapid judgments. Here, we introduce a new psychophysical task and report model-based analyses of human behavior that demonstrate evidence integration at long timescales. Our task requires probabilistic inference using brief samples of visual evidence that are separated in time by long and unpredictable gaps. We show through several quantitative assays how decision-making can approximate a normative integration process that extends over tens of seconds without accruing significant memory leak or noise. These results support the generalization of evidence integration models to a broader class of behaviors while posing new challenges for models of how these computations are implemented in biological networks.},

abstract = {Gardner and Altman explained the rationale for using estimation and confidence intervals in making inferences from analytical studies and described their calculation for means or proportions and their differences. ' In this paper we present methods for calculating confidence intervals for other common statistics obtained from medical investigations. The techniques for obtaining confidence intervals for estimates of relative risk are described. These can come either from an incidence study, where, for example, the frequency of a congenital malformation at birth is compared in two defined groups of mothers, or from a case-control study, where a group of patients with the disease of interest (the cases) is compared with another group of people without the disease (the controls). The methods of obtaining confidence intervals for standardised disease ratios and rates in studies of incidence, prevalence, and mortality are described. Such rates and ratios are commonly calculated to enable appropriate comparisons to be made between study groups after adjustment for confounding factors like age and sex. The most frequently used standardised indices are the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and the standardised mortality ratio (SMR). A worked example is included for each method. The calculations have been carried out to full arithmetical precision, as is recommended practice,2 although intermediate steps are shown as rounded results. Some of the methods given in this paper are large sample approximations and are not reliable for studies with fewer than about 20 cases. Appropriate design principles for these types of study have to be adhered to since confidence intervals convey only the effects of sampling variation on the precision of the estimated statistics and cannot control for other errors such as biases due to the selection of inappropriate controls or in the methods of collecting the data.},

abstract = {Although interest regarding the role of dispositional affect in job behaviors has surged in recent years, the true magnitude of affectivity's influence remains unknown. To address this issue, the authors conducted a qualitative and quantitative review of the relationships between positive and negative affectivity (PA and NA, respectively) and various performance dimensions. A series of meta-analyses based on 57 primary studies indicated that PA and NA predicted task performance in the hypothesized directions and that the relationships were strongest for subjectively rated versus objectively rated performance. In addition, PA was related to organizational citizenship behaviors but not withdrawal behaviors, and NA was related to organizational citizenship behaviors, withdrawal behaviors, counterproductive work behaviors, and occupational injury. Mediational analyses revealed that affect operated through different mechanisms in influencing the various performance dimensions. Regression analyses documented that PA and NA uniquely predicted task performance but that extraversion and neuroticism did not, when the four were considered simultaneously. Discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {We evaluated age-related differences in the optimality of decision boundary settings in a diffusion model analysis. In the model, the width of the decision boundary represents the amount of evidence that must accumulate in favor of a response alternative before a decision is made. Wide boundaries lead to slow but accurate responding, and narrow boundaries lead to fast but inaccurate responding. There is a single value of boundary separation that produces the most correct answers in a given period of time, and we refer to this value as the reward rate optimal boundary (RROB). We consistently found across a variety of decision tasks that older adults used boundaries that were much wider than the RROB value. Young adults used boundaries that were closer to the RROB value, although age differences in optimality were smaller with instructions emphasizing speed than with instructions emphasizing accuracy. Young adults adjusted their boundary settings to more closely approach the RROB value when they were provided with accuracy feedback and extensive practice. Older participants showed no evidence of making boundary adjustments in response to feedback or task practice, and they consistently used boundary separation values that produced accuracy levels that were near asymptote. Our results suggest that young adults attempt to balance speed and accuracy to achieve the most correct answers per unit time, whereas older adultts attempt to minimize errors even if they must respond quite slowly to do so.},

abstract = {Psychological models of temporal discounting have now successfully displaced classical economic theory due to the simple fact that many common behavior patterns, such as impulsivity, were unexplainable with classic models. However, the now dominant hyperbolic model of discounting is itself becoming increasingly strained. Numerous factors have arisen that alter discount rates with no means to incorporate the different influences into standard hyperbolic models. Furthermore, disparate literatures are emerging that propose theoretical constructs that are seemingly independent of hyperbolic discounting. We argue that, although hyperbolic discounting provides an eminently useful quantitative measure of discounting, it fails as a descriptive psychological model of the cognitive processes that produce intertemporal preferences. Instead, we propose that recent contributions from cognitive neuroscience indicate a path for developing a general model of time discounting. New data suggest a means by which neuroscience-based theory may both integrate the diverse empirical data on time preferences and merge seemingly disparate theoretical models that impinge on time preferences.},

Sixty-six normal volunteers spent either 3 (n = 18), 5 (n= 16), 7 (n = 16), or 9 h (n = 16) daily time in bed (TIB) for 7 days (restriction/augmentation) followed by 3 days with 8 h daily TIB (recovery). In the 3-h group, speed (mean and fastest 10{\%} of responses) on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) declined, and PVT lapses (reaction times greater than 500 ms) increased steadily across the 7 days of sleep restriction. In the 7- and 5-h groups speed initially declined, then appeared to stabilize at a reduced level; lapses were increased only in the 5-h group. In the 9-h group, speed and lapses remained at baseline levels. During recovery, PVT speed in the 7- and 5-h groups (and lapses in the 5-h group) remained at the stable, but reduced levels seen during the last days of the experimental phase, with no evidence of recovery. Speed and lapses in the 3-h group recovered rapidly following the first night of recovery sleep; however, recovery was incomplete with speed and lapses stabilizing at a level comparable with the 7- and 5-h groups. Performance in the 9-h group remained at baseline levels during the recovery phase. These results suggest that the brain adapts to chronic sleep restriction. In mild to moderate sleep restriction this adaptation is sufficient to stabilize performance, although at a reduced level. These adaptive changes are hypothesized to restrict brain operational capacity and to persist for several days after normal sleep duration is restored, delaying recovery.},

abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology.},

When money loses its physical form it is perceived as "not quite the same" money (i.e., to have partly lost the original essence that distinguished it from other monetary tokens), diminishing its intuitive link with its original owner. Participants were less likely to recommend stolen or lost money be returned when it had been subsequently deposited in an electronic bank account, as opposed to retaining its original physical form (Studies 1a and 1b). Conversely, an intuitive sense of ownership is enhanced through physical contact with a piece of hard currency. Participants felt the piece of currency a person had originally lost should be returned to him rather than another piece of currency of equivalent value, even when they did not believe he would be able to tell the difference and considered distinguishing it from other money illogical. This effect was reduced when the currency had been sterilized, wiping it clean of all physical traces of its previous owner (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3).},

A recurrent problem in experimental eco-nomics is that of ensuring that subjects have an incentive to give considered and truthful responses. One common experimental de-sign is to ask subjects to perform a number of tasks, each of which requires a choice among lotteries with monetary payoffs. At the end of the experiment, one of these tasks is selected by a random device, and the subject plays out the lottery that he or she chose in that task. This is the random-lottery procedure. This incentive system has several attrac-tive features. It allows the experimenter to collect a considerable amount of data from each subject, thus economizing on the costs of recruiting subjects and allowing tests that compare a subject's responses to two or more tasks. At the same time, it avoids the problem of reference-point and wealth ef-fects that would be created if subjects were paid according to their performances on each of a number of tasks.

The present study sought to validate the inner workings of one such model, Three Process Model (TPM), on aircrews and extend the model with functions to model jetlag and to directly assess the risk of any sleepiness level in any shift schedule or roster with and without knowledge of sleep timings. We collected sleep and sleepiness data from 136 aircrews in a real life situation by means of an application running on a handheld touch screen computer device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) and used the TPM to predict sleepiness with varying level of complexity of model equations and data. The results based on multilevel linear and non-linear mixed effects models showed that the TPM predictions correlated with observed ratings of sleepiness, but explorative analyses suggest that the default model can be improved and reduced to include only two-processes (S+C), with adjusted phases of the circadian process based on a single question of circadian type. We also extended the model with a function to model jetlag acclimatization and with estimates of individual differences including reference limits accounting for 50{\%}, 75{\%} and 90{\%} of the population as well as functions for predicting the probability of any level of sleepiness for ecological assessment of absolute and relative risk of sleepiness in shift systems for safety applications.

In the Bayesian approach to implementing, testing, and using cognitive models, assumptions can influence both the like-lihood function of the model, usually corresponding to assumptions about psychological processes, and the prior distribution over model parameters, usually corresponding to assumptions about the psychological variables that influ-ence those processes. The specification of the prior is unique to the Bayesian context, but often raises concerns that lead to the use of vague or non-informative priors in cognitive modeling. Sometimes the concerns stem from philosophi-cal objections, but more often practical difficulties with how priors should be determined are the stumbling block. We survey several sources of information that can help to spec-ify priors for cognitive models, discuss some of the methods by which this information can be formalized in a prior dis-tribution, and identify a number of benefits of including informative priors in cognitive modeling. Our discussion is based on three illustrative cognitive models, involving memory retention, categorization, and decision making.},

When stimulus strength is high, accuracy is high and response time is fast; when stimulus strength is low, accuracy is low and response time is slow. Although the psychometric function is well established as a tool for analyzing the relationship between accuracy and stimulus strength, the corresponding chronometric function for the relationship between response time and stimulus strength has not received as much consideration. In this article, we describe a theory of perceptual decision making based on a diffusion model. In it, a decision is based on the additive accumulation of sensory evidence over time to a bound. Combined with simple scaling assumptions, the proportional-rate and power-rate diffusion models predict simple analytic expressions for both the chronometric and psychometric functions. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we show that this theory accounts for response time and accuracy as a function of both stimulus strength and speed-accuracy instructions. In particular, the results demonstrate a close coupling between response time and accuracy. The theory is also shown to subsume the predictions of Pi{\'{e}}ron's Law, a power function dependence of response time on stimulus strength. The theory's analytic chronometric function allows one to extend theories of accuracy to response time.},

It was also a novel task for participants. Participants who had an implicit theory that group-management ability is an incremental skill that can be acquired with experience developed stronger self-efficacy, maintained more positive affect, and set themselves more challenging goals across multiple trials. They also outperformed participants with a fixed-entity theory of group-management ability. Some of the motivational benefits of an incremental-skill conception were lost when the social construal of managerial ability emphasized a fixed-entity conception. However, the negative motivational effects of a fixed-entity theory of ability were not ameliorated by the social construal of managerial ability as an incremental skill. The effects of conceptions of ability were fully mediated by the self-regulatory responses of participants. The hypothesis that self-efficacy moderates the impact of ability conceptions on self-set goal challenges was not supported. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

Previous research on intertemporal choice has suggested that intertemporal preferences might be intransitive, for which nonadditivity in delay discounting is 1 of the reasons. Most studies in this line of research have either analyzed aggregate data or ignored the probabilistic nature of intertemporal choice when addressing individual data. In this article, I present a refined experiment for studying transitivity of intertemporal preferences with repeatedly presented choice questions tailored to each individual participant. A Bayesian model comparison was applied to the individual choice data to test 4 stochastic models of transitivity—weak, moderate, and strong stochastic transitiv-ity, as well as a mixture model of transitive preference—against the most general model allowing for all types of preference orders, and intermediate models accommodating nonaddi-tivity in delay discounting. The results show that individual data from a majority of participants were consistent with a transitive view of intertemporal preferences. In addition, nonadditivity in delay discounting—defined as special cases of violating weak, moderate, or strong stochastic transitivity—rarely occurred at an individual level. These findings provide critical information for developing and testing competing cognitive models of intertemporal choice.},

abstract = {In two experimental studies we investigated the effect of beliefs about the nature and purpose of science (classical vs. Kuhnian models of science) on responses to uncertainty in scientific messages about climate change risk. The results revealed a significant interaction between both measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Study 2) beliefs about science and the level of communicated uncertainty on willingness to act in line with the message. Specifically, messages that communicated high uncertainty were more persuasive for participants who shared an understanding of science as debate than for those who believed that science is a search for absolute truth. In addition, participants who had a concept of science as debate were more motivated by higher (rather than lower) uncertainty in climate change messages. The results suggest that achieving alignment between the general public's beliefs about science and the style of the scientific messages is crucial for successful risk communication in science. Accordingly, rather than uncertainty always undermining the effectiveness of science communication, uncertainty can enhance message effects when it fits the audience's understanding of what science is.},

abstract = {We present a method that dynamically designs elicitation questions for estimating risk and time preference parameters. Typically these parameters are elicited by presenting decision makers with a series of static choices between alternatives, gambles, or delayed payments. The proposed method dynamically (i.e., adaptively) designs such choices to optimize the information provided by each choice, while leveraging the distribution of the parameters across decision makers (heterogeneity) and capturing response error. We explore the convergence and the validity of our approach using simulations. The simulations suggest that the proposed method recovers true parameter values well under various circumstances. We then use an online experiment to compare our approach to a standard one used in the literature that requires comparable task completion time. We assess predictive accuracy in an out-of-sample task and completion time for both methods. For risk preferences, our results indicate that the proposed method predicts subjects' willingness to pay for a set of out-of-sample gambles significantly more accurately, while taking respondents about the same time to complete. For time preferences, both methods predict out-of-sample preferences equally well, while the proposed method takes significantly less completion time. For risk and time preferences, average completion time for our approach is approximately three minutes. Finally, we briefly review three applications that used the proposed methodology with various populations, and we discuss the potential benefits of the proposed methodology for research and practice.},

Background The present study was designed to provide validation on the individual level of predictions using the Three Process-Model of alertness regulation. Model predictions of sleep timing were also tested. Method Sixteen shift workers participated in the study. Ratings of sleepiness were made every 2 h across three shifts. The model was used to predict empirical ratings using as input only information of beginning and end of work shifts, as well as using information on sleep from actigraphs (in a separate analysis). Results The prediction using only information on work shifts correlated r = 0.55 (p {\textless} 0.001) with empirical ratings. Predictions were generally within ± 1 confidence interval of the ratings. Adding actigraphy sleep data improved predictions marginally. The model predictions of onset and offset of sleep were generally close to the target. Conclusions It was concluded that model predictions have a rather high validity both with respect to sleepiness and to sleep timing. It is probable that other information on individual differences will further improve predictability.},

In the research reported here, we focus on attribute and goal framing. LSG propose that positive frames should be more effective than negative frames in the context of attribute framing, and negative frames should be more effective than positive frames in the context of goal framing. We test this framework by manipulating frame valence (positive vs negative) and frame type (attribute vs goal) in a unified context with common procedures. We also argue that the nature of effects in a goal-framing context may depend on the extent to which the research topic has "intrinsic self-relevance" to the population. In the context of medical decision making, we operationalize low intrinsic self-relevance by using student subjects and high intrinsic self-relevance by using patients. As expected, we find complete support for the LSG framework under low intrinsic self-relevance and modified support for the LSG framework under high intrinsic self-relevance. Overall, our research appears to confirm and extend the LSG framework. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Bayesian estimation has played a pivotal role in the understanding of individual differences. However, for many models in psychology, Bayesian estimation of model parameters can be difficult. One reason for this difficulty is that conventional sampling algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), can be inefficient and impractical when little is known about the target distribution--particularly the target distribution's covariance structure. In this article, we highlight some reasons for this inefficiency and advocate the use of a population MCMC algorithm, called differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC), as a means of efficient proposal generation. We demonstrate in a simulation study that the performance of the DE-MCMC algorithm is unaffected by the correlation of the target distribution, whereas conventional MCMC performs substantially worse as the correlation increases. We then show that the DE-MCMC algorithm can be used to efficiently fit a hierarchical version of the linear ballistic accumulator model to response time data, which has proven to be a difficult task when conventional MCMC is used.},

Both partners in a TGD system possess and pursue self-oriented, partner-oriented, and system-oriented goals, and all of these goals and pursuits are interdependent. TGD theory states that relationship partners' goals, pursuit, and outcomes affect each other in a dense network of goal interdependence, ultimately becoming so tightly linked that the 2 partners are most accurately conceptualized as components within a single self-regulating system.

We addressed this issue by measuring neural activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while volunteers processed delayed and probabilistic decision options. Behaviorally, participants discounted both types of rewards in a hyperbolic manner, and discount rates, reflecting individual preferences, varied considerably between participants. Ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex showed a domain-general coding of subjective value regardless of whether rewards were delayed or probabilistic, strongly implicating these regions in the implementation of a common neural currency of value. In contrast, fronto-polar and lateral parietal cortex, as well as a region in the posterior cingulate cortex only correlated with the value of delayed rewards, whereas superior parietal cortex and middle occipital areas only represented the value of probabilistic rewards. These results suggest a mechanism for the neural coding of subjective value in the human brain that is based on the combination of domain-general and domain-specific valuation networks.},

abstract = {The application of network centric operations to time-constrained command and control environments will mean that human operators will be increasingly responsible for multiple simultaneous supervisory control tasks. One such futuristic application will be the control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by a single operator. To achieve such performance in complex, time critical, and high risk settings, automated systems will be required both to guarantee rapid system response, as well as manageable workload for operators. Through the development of a simulation test bed for human supervisory control of multiple independent UAVs by a single operator, this paper presents recent efforts to investigate workload mitigation strategies as a function of increasing automation. A human-in-the-loop experiment revealed that under low workload conditions, operators' cognitive strategies were relatively robust across increasing levels of automated decision support. However, when provided with explicit automated recommendations and with the ability to negotiate with external agencies for delays in arrival times for targets, operators inappropriately fixated on the need to globally optimize their schedules. In addition, without explicit visual representation of uncertainty, operators tended to treated all probabilities uniformly. This study also revealed that operators who reached cognitive saturation adapted two very distinct management strategies, which led to varying degrees of success. Lastly, operators with management-by-exception decision support exhibited evidence of automation bias. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

Review of General Psychology 2, 271-299] process-based framework of emotion regulation as a guiding structure. In addition to examining employee self-reported usage of these emotion regulation strategies, we assessed the types of discrete negative emotions and negative affective events associated with their use. Results demonstrated that employees reported using a wide variety of emotion regulation strategies, and that each strategy tended to align with a distinct set of discrete negative emotions and affective events. These findings support expanding the focus of emotion regulation strategies at work beyond the deep acting (i.e., changing feelings) and surface acting (i.e., changing expressions) distinction. The results also suggest that focusing on specific strategies, rather than categories of emotion regulation, could enhance understanding of how employees manage their emotions at work. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The ultimate goal is to improve judgments and decisions, or keep them from getting worse. In order to achieve this goal we need to know what good judgments and decisions are. That is, we need criteria for evaluation, so that we can gather data on the goodness of judgments, find out what makes them better or worse, and test method for improving them when there is room for improvement.

Human brain reactions (event-related potentials) and body reactions (heart rate, skin conductance, the probe startle reflex) were assessed along motivational gradients determined by apparent distance from sites of potential punishment or reward. A predator-prey survival context was simulated using cues that signaled possible money rewards or possible losses; the cues appeared to loom progressively closer to the viewer, until a final step when a rapid key response could ensure reward or avoid a punishing loss. The observed anticipatory response patterns of heightened vigilance and physiological mobilization are consistent with the view that the physiology of emotion is founded on action dispositions that evolved in mammals to facilitate survival by dealing with threats or capturing life-sustaining rewards.},

This paper provides the broader rationale and context for subjectivity, and in it we show that subjectivity is the key to principled measures of evidence for theory from data. By making our subjective elements focal, we provide an avenue for common sense and expertise to enter the analysis. We cover the role of models in linking theory to data, the notion that models are abstractions which are neither true nor false, the need for relative model comparison, the role of predictions in stating relative evidence for models, and the role of subjectivity in specifying models that yield predictions. In the end, we conclude that transparent subjectivity leads to a more honest and fruitful analyses in psychological science.},

The current study aim was to examine how individuals self-manage their gambling through (a) assessing frequency of use of a range of self-regulation strategies (b) examining how these strategies cluster and (c) exploring relationships between strategies, gambling frequency, amount spent and problem gambling severity. A sample of 303 gamblers was recruited, over-sampling for problem gamblers as assessed by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) of the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (mean age 26.4 years, SD = 10.1 years; 119 males, 184 females; 238 social gamblers, 63 problem gamblers, 2 unclassified). They rated extent of usage of 27 gambling self-management techniques and completed the PGSI and other gambling measures. Factor analysis of items produced five factors, named Cognitive Approaches, Direct Action, Social Experience, Avoidance and Limit Setting. The relationships between these factors and key gambling variables were consistent with hypotheses that problem gamblers trying to reduce their gambling would be more likely to use the strategies than other gambler groups. The potential for developing the factors into a Gambling Self-regulation Measure was explored.},

These hypotheses were examined in three studies (two of them longitudinal) that measured participants' dispositional social motives, short-term social goals, and social outcomes (e.g., loneliness). Approach motives and goals were reliably associated with less loneliness and more satisfaction with social bonds, whereas avoidance motives and goals were reliably associated with more loneliness, negative social attitudes, and relationship insecurity. Results also suggested that these associations were mediated by different processes. Implications for the conceptualization of close relationships along these two dimensions are discussed.},

Despite its promising capabilities, there is still some resistance in the literature concerning the advantages of these quantum-like models towards classical ones. In this work, we developed a Classical Latent Bayesian network model and we compared it against its quantum counterpart: the quantum-like Bayesian network. The comparison was done using a well known Prisoner's Dilemma game experiment from Shafir and Tversky (1992), in which the classical axioms of probability theory are violated during a decision, and consequently the game cannot be simulated by pure classical models. In the end, we concluded that it is possible to simulate these violations using the Classical Latent Variable model, but with an exponential increase in its complexity. Moreover, this classical model cannot predict both observed and unobserved conditions from Shafir and Tversky (1992) experiments. The quantum-like model, on the other hand, is shown to be able to accommodate both situations for observed and unobserved events in a single model, making it more suitable and more general for these types of decision problems.},

In three experiments we found that both state and chronic differences in experienced construal level modulate the impact of progress framing on motivation at a specific stage in goal pursuit, i.e., when consumers are halfway between the initial and end state, but is less consequential at the initial or end stages. This modulation shows that type of framing only affected motivation of people with an abstract, but not a concrete mindset. Under these conditions, progress framed in terms of to-date produced increased motivation compared to a to-go frame. Moreover, perceived goal distance was found to mediate the impact of progress framing on motivation for individuals with an abstract, but not a concrete mindset. ?? 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.},

Extensions of the LCM, like the the Latent Change Score Model (LCSM), have also increased in popularity. At the same time, the R statistical language and environment, which is open source and runs on several operating systems, is becoming a leading software for applied statistics. We show how to estimate both the LCM and LCSM with the sem, lavaan, and OpenMx packages of the R software. We also illustrate how to read in, summarize, and plot data prior to analyses. Examples are provided on data previously illustrated by Ferrer, Hamagami, {\&} McArdle, 2004. The data and all scripts used here are available on the first author's website. A few years ago Ferrer, Hamagami, and McArdle (2004) illustrated how to estimate the parameters of the Latent Curve Model (LCM) with a number of different software programs, all of which, except two (Mx and R), were and still are commercial. Since then three phenomena of interest have occurred. First, the LCM is now well-known and often applied by many researchers in several disciplines. This phenomenon is intimately associated to the progress many software have made to implement this model. Indeed, several software programs include dedicated functions or plugins that spare the user typing or drawing the single LCM elements.

abstract = {Explaining group-level outcomes from individual-level predictors requires aggregating the individual-level scores to the group level and correcting the group-level estimates for measurement errors in the aggregated scores. However, for discrete variables it is not clear how to perform the aggregation and correction. It is shown how stepwise latent class analysis can be used to do this. First, a latent class model is estimated in which the scores on a discrete individual-level predictor are used to construct group-level latent classes. Second, this latent class model is used to aggregate the individual-level predictor by assigning the groups to the latent classes. Third, a group-level analysis is performed in which the aggregated measures are related to the remaining group-level variables while correcting for the measurement error in the class assignments. This stepwise approach is introduced in a multilevel mediation model with a single individual-level mediator, and compared to existing methods in a simulation study. We also show how a mediation model with multiple group-level latent variables can be used with multiple individual-level mediators and this model is applied to explain team productivity (group level) as a function of job control (individual level), job satisfaction (individual level), and enriched job design (group level).},

abstract = {Accumulation is a fundamental process in dynamic systems: inventory accumulates production less shipments; the national debt accumulates the federal deficit. Effective decision making in such systems requires an understanding of the relationship between stocks and the flows that alter them. However, highly educated people are often unable to infer the behavior of simple stock-flow systems. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that poor understanding of accumulation, termed stock-flow failure, is a fundamental reasoning error. Persistent poor performance is not attributable to an inability to interpret graphs, lack of contextual knowledge, motivation, or cognitive capacity. Rather, stock-flow failure is a robust phenomenon that appears to be rooted in failure to appreciate the most basic principles of accumulation, leading to the use of inappropriate heuristics. We show that many people, including highly educated individuals with strong technical training, use what we term the "correlation heuristic", erroneously assuming that the behavior of a stock matches the pattern of its flows. We discuss the origins of stock-flow failure and implications for management and education. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent studies of the structure of affect, positive and negative affect have consistently emerged as two dominant and relatively independent dimensions. A number of mood scales have been created to measure these factors; however, many existing measures are inadequate, showing low reliability or poor convergent or discriminant validity. To fill the need for reliable and valid Positive Affect and Negative Affect scales that are also brief and easy to administer, we developed two 10-item mood scales that comprise the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented.},

abstract = {We examine the effects of multiple sources of noise in risky decision making. Noise in the parameters that characterize an individual's preferences can combine with noise in the response process to distort observed choice proportions. Thus, underlying preferences that conform to expected value maximization can appear to show systematic risk aversion or risk seeking. Similarly, core preferences that are consistent with expected utility theory, when perturbed by such noise, can appear to display nonlinear probability weighting. For this reason, modal choices cannot be used simplistically to infer underlying preferences. Quantitative model fits that do not allow for both sorts of noise can lead to wrong conclusions.},

abstract = {There is an important gap between the number of bladder cancer cases - over a 1000 per year - that are imputable, by epidemiologists'estimations, to occupational factors and the small number - fewer than 20 - compensated as occupational diseases. This can be explained by the latency of the disease and by the fact that the chemicals mainly responsible for bladder cancer - aromatic amines compounds and, to a lesser extent, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - are very complex and disseminated in a large variety of industrial settings. Besides the sectors historically known as involving this occupational risk - the dye and the rubber industries - new branches have been identified as hazardous: some sectors of plastic materials or aluminium industries, of laboratory research, the industrial gas production from coke ovens, foundries... The European policy for the prevention of occupational cancers has applied for over 10 years to carcinogenic aromatic amines. Screening for the early detection of vesical lesions is legally prescribed in France for workers that are or have been exposed to chemicals or processes potentially carcinogenic for the bladder.},

@article{Cheema2011,
abstract = {This research demonstrates that as people approach a goal, external representations, which increase the ease of visualizing the goal, enhance goal pursuit. Specifically, consumers judge easy-to-visualize goals to be closer than difficult-to-visualize goals, which in turn increases effort and commitment. Ease of visualization affects performance in swimming competitions and the physical effort exerted in the lab. Visualization also affects commitment toward savings, willingness to wait for service, and performance in a simulated sales task. Importantly, the beneficial effects of visualization exist only when people are close to the goal. In addition, the effect of visualization attenuates when the goal is split into subgoals. Managers can use these results to enhance consumer goal pursuit, influence consumer satisfaction in online service encounters, and motivate employees to improve performance. In these varied contexts, visual representations of goal progress (e.g., progress bars) enhance motivation as people approach their goal.

abstract = {It is believed that medical diagnosis involves two complementary processes, analytic and similarity-based. There is considerable debate as to which of these processes defines diagnostic expertise and how best to teach clinical diagnosis and reduce diagnostic errors. The purpose of these studies is to document the use of these strategies in medical students. We shifted the balance in use of these processes and improved diagnostic accuracy with instructions given posttraining at the moment of diagnosis. Analytic processing reflecting the degree to which cases contain the diagnostic rules was indexed by the rate of accuracy on typical versus atypical cases (typicality effect). Similarity-based processing reflecting the degree to which cases resemble previously encountered cases was indexed by the rate of accuracy on similar versus dissimilar cases (similarity effect). Two studies are presented illustrating that diagnosis involves the coordination of analytic and similarity-based processes and that differential instruction given at test shifts the balance in the use of these processes. Study 1 illustrated that participants adopting an analytic strategy exhibit a larger effect of typicality. Participants adopting a similarity-based strategy exhibit a larger effect of similarity. The diagnostic approach of students given no instructions was predominantly analytic. Dual instructions in which participants first employed similarity-based processing followed by the application of rules improved overall accuracy. Study 2 investigated two versions of dual instructions and illustrated that assessing a case with the rules of diagnosis first may inhibit the subsequent use of similarity-based reasoning. The implications for diagnostic expertise and pedagogy are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study tested whether forming implementation intentions is an effective strategy for attaining health goals focused on trying to avoid a negative state.

DESIGN: Participants chose to either eat more healthy snacks (i.e., an approach goal) or eat fewer unhealthy snacks (i.e., an avoidance goal) over two weeks and were randomly assigned to create an implementation intention to do this or not.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The authors measured fat and calorie intake after one week and after two weeks.

RESULTS: After two weeks, the participants who ate most unhealthily were those who pursued an avoidance goal and did not form an implementation intention.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that forming implementation intentions for avoidance goal pursuit can help people attain important health goals.},

abstract = {We reviewed 122 studies and compared the relative effectiveness of cooperation, cooperation with intergroup competition, interpersonal competition, and individ-ualistic goal structures in promoting achievement and productivity in North American samples. These studies yielded 286 findings. Three meta-analysis pro-cedures were used: voting method, effect-size method, and z-scorc method. The results of the meta-analyses indicate (a) that cooperation is considerably more effective than interpersonal competition and individualistic efforts, (b) that co-operation with intergroup competition is also superior to interpersonal compe-tition and individualistic efforts, and (c) that there is no significant difference between interpersonal competitive and individualistic efforts. Through multiple regression, a number of potentially mediating variables for these results are identified. Since the 1920s there has been a great deal of research on the relative effects of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts on achievement and productivity. Despite the large number of studies con-ducted, social scientists disagree as to the conclusions that may be drawn from the lit-erature. Several psychologists have reviewed subsets of studies within the area and have arrived at contradictory conclusions. There is therefore a need to review all the research literature to resolve the controversies. This article is an attempt to do so through the use of meta-analysis, Definition of Goal Structures Four goal structures are commonly stud-ied: (a) cooperation, (b) cooperation with intergroup competition, (c) interpersonal competition, and (d) individualistic efforts. There are two major approaches to defining these conditions, one evolving from the in-trinsic motivation point of view of Lewin's (1935) field theory, the other from the ex-trinsic motivation point of view of behavioral learning theory.},

The current research assessed the content and factor structure variation of ILTs for male and female perceivers (separately and combined) across three stimuli: leaders, effective leaders and supervisors. Results suggest eight distinct factors of ILTs (Sensitivity, Dedication, Tyranny, Charisma, Attractiveness, Masculinity, Intelligence and Strength) that remain relatively stable across both perceiver sex and stimuli. Implicit theories for leaders and effective leaders were typically more favorable than for supervisors. These findings suggest that implicit theories of leadership may vary in systematic ways and underscore the importance of reaching beyond mere recognition of the existence of such theories toward an understanding of variations in both the content and the structure of the implicit ways that people view leaders. ?? 1994.},

In an experimental test of the theory, we systematically change the shape of revealed utility, weighting, and discounting functions by manipulating the distribution of monies, probabilities, and delays in the choices used to elicit them. The data demonstrate that there is no stable mapping between attribute values and their subjective equivalents. Expected and discounted utility theories, and also their descendants such as prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting theory, simply assert stable mappings to describe choice data and offer no account of the instability we find. We explain where the shape of the mapping comes from and, in describing the mechanism by which people choose, explain why the shape depends on the distribution of gains, losses, risks, and delays in the environment},

Overall, 55{\%} of all analyzed results were found to provide BF {\textgreater} 10 (often labeled as strong evidence) for the alternative hypothesis, while more than half of the remaining results do not pass the level of BF = 3 (labeled as anecdotal evidence). The results estimate that at least 82{\%} of all published psychological articles contain one or more significant results that do not provide BF {\textgreater} 10 for the hypothesis. We conclude that due to the threshold of acceptance having been set too low for psychological findings, a substantial proportion of the published results have weak evidential support.},

abstract = {The sleep homeostatic Process S reflects the build-up of sleep pressure during waking and its dissipation during sleep. Process S is modelled as a saturating exponential function during waking and a decreasing exponential function during sleep. Slow wave activity is a physiological marker for non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep intensity and serves as an index of Process S. There is considerable interindividual variability in the sleep homeostatic responses to sleep and sleep deprivation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether interindi- vidual differences in Process S are trait-like. Polysomnographic record- ings of 8 nights (12-h sleep opportunities, 22:00–10:00 hours) interspersed with three 36-h periods of sustained wakefulness were performed in 11 healthy young adults. Empirical mean slow wave activity per non-REM sleep episode at episode mid-points were used for parameter estimation. Parameters of Process S were estimated using different combinations of consecutive sleep recordings, resulting in two to three sets of parameters per subject. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to assess whether the parameters were stable across the study protocol and they showed trait-like variability among individ- uals. We found that the group-average time constants of the build-up and dissipation of Process S were 19.2 and 2.7 h, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.48 to 0.56, which reflects moderate trait variability. The time constants of the build-up and dissipation varied independently among subjects, indicating two distinct traits. We conclude that interindividual differences in the parameters of the dynamics of the sleep},

abstract = {This study attempts to combine two traditional fields in microeconomics: individual decision making under risk and decision making in an interpersonal context. The influence of social comparison on risky choices is explored in an experiment in which participants make a series of choices between lotteries with only positive outcomes. Three kinds of choice situations are employed. In the loss and gain context the social referent receives a fixed payoff that is respectively higher and lower than all possible payoffs of the decision maker. In the neutral context social referent and decision maker will always earn the same amount. In the gain and loss contexts the decision maker has no influence on the earnings of the social referent so strategic behavior or social preferences can play no role. We find that decision makers are more risk-averse in the loss context than in the gain context, with the behavior in the neutral context in between. This result is in opposition to the predictions of prospect theory extrapolated to a social context.},

abstract = {Animal approach-avoidance conflict paradigms have been used extensively to characterize effects of anxiolytic agents and probe neural circuitry related to anxiety. However, there are few behavioral approaches to measure conflict in human populations, limiting the translation of findings from animal conflict tasks to human clinical research. We developed a novel approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) paradigm involving situations in which the same decision is associated with "reward" (points) and "punishment" (negative affective stimuli). The AAC task was completed by 95 young adults (56 female) with varying levels of self-reported trait anxiety. As expected, conflict-related approach behavior correlated with self-reported motivation to approach reward and avoid punishment and greater reward level increased approach behavior. Additionally, females exhibited less approach behavior than males. Anxiety Sensitivity Index (Physical subscale) scores related negatively to approach behavior for males, while Behavioral Activation Scale (BAS, Fun Seeking subscale) scores related positively to approach behavior for females. Results support the utility of the AAC task as a behavioral test that has strong reverse translational features. Findings indicate that approach drives and anxiety sensitivity may be important in determining conflict behavior for females and males respectively. The approach-avoidance conflict task offers a novel, translational measure to probe neural systems underlying conflict behavior, motivational processes, and anxiety disorders.},

Not only can the same outcomes be more rewarding if we apply more (not less) effort, sometimes we select options precisely because they require effort.

We conduct a laboratory experiment in which subjects make decision on behalf of themselves and others in eighteen tasks that measure the following biases: present-bias in time preferences, reflection effect in risk preferences, ambiguity aversion, decoy effect, anchoring bias, endowment effect, and identifiable-victim bias. In our experiment, DMfO is DMfO simpliciter: unincentivized decisions made by one individual on behalf of another - the individual making decisions faces no direct costs or benefits when engaging in DMfO (as they would in a principal-agent framework or with bequest motives), and DMfO is not framed as giving advice or guessing behavior. We identify the following self-other discrepancies: (i) willingness to pay is higher in DMfO than in decisions for oneself in tasks associated with the anchoring bias, endowment effect, and identifiable-victim bias; and (ii) the propensity to give uninterpretable responses is higher in DMfO than in decisions for oneself. We also find order effects, with DMfO more similar to decisions for oneself when it follows them. Lastly, in response to open-ended items soliciting self-reports of their DMfO, most subjects report having followed some version of the “Golden Rule” (e.g., deciding for others as they would for themselves) or having tried to maximize the other subject's payment or utility; very few subjects report motivations that can be construed as rivalrous.},

A body of data and theory has been devel-oping within psychology which should be of interest to economists. Taken at face value the data are simply inconsistent with preference theory and have broad implications about research priorities within economics. The inconsistency is deeper than the mere lack of transitivity or even stochastic transitivity. It suggests that no optimization principles of any sort lie behind even the simplest of human choices and that the uniformities in human choice behavior which lie behind market behavior may result from principles which are of a completely different sort from those generally accepted. This paper reports the results of a series of experiments designed to discredit the psychologists' works as applied to economics.},

abstract = {Random dot motion (RDM) displays have emerged as one of the standard stimulus types employed in psychophysical and physiological studies of motion processing. RDMs are convenient because it is straightforward to manipulate the relative motion energy for a given motion direction in addition to stimulus parameters such as the speed, contrast, duration, density, aperture, etc. However, as widely as RDMs are employed so do they vary in their details of implementation. As a result, it is often difficult to make direct comparisons across studies employing different RDM algorithms and parameters. Here, we systematically measure the ability of human subjects to estimate motion direction for four commonly used RDM algorithms under a range of parameters in order to understand how these different algorithms compare in their perceptibility. We find that parametric and algorithmic differences can produce dramatically different performances. These effects, while surprising, can be understood in relationship to pertinent neurophysiological data regarding spatiotemporal displacement tuning properties of cells in area MT and how the tuning function changes with stimulus contrast and retinal eccentricity. These data help give a baseline by which different RDM algorithms can be compared, demonstrate a need for clearly reporting RDM details in the methods of papers, and also pose new constraints and challenges to models of motion direction processing.},

For example, at a within-person level of analysis, Vancouver, Thompson, and Williams (2001) found that performance accomplishments had a strong and positive influence upon subsequent efficacy beliefs; however, self-efficacy had a negative relationship with subsequent performance. The present set of experiments extends this research. Design: Two experiments examine the reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy and learning/performance over time. Method: Novice golfers putted across two conditions that varied in task difficulty. Results: Across both experiments, performance had a significant, strong and positive relationship with subsequent self-efficacy and predicted (at best) 49{\%} of efficacy variance. However, self-efficacy had a weak non-significant negative relationship with subsequent performance in Experiment 1 and in Experiment 2 and only explained (at best) 2.7{\%} of performance variance. Conclusion: The findings reveal that the reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy and performance may not be as strong as previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent debates in the psychological literature have raised questions about what assumptions underpin Bayesian models of cognition, and what inferences they license about human cognition. In this paper we revisit this topic, arguing that there are two qualitatively different ways in which a Bayesian model could be constructed. If a Bayesian model is intended to license a claim about optimality then the priors and likelihoods in the model must be constrained by reference to some external criterion. A descriptive Bayesian model need not correspond to any claim that the underlying cognition is optimal or rational, and is used solely as a tool for instantiating a substantive psychological theory. We present three case studies in which these two perspectives lead to different computational models and license different conclusions about human cognition. We argue that the descriptive Bayesian approach is more useful overall, especially when combined with principled tools for model evaluation and model selection. More generally we argue for the importance of making a clear distinction between the two perspectives. Considerable confusion results when descriptive models and optimal models are conflated, and if Bayesians are to avoid contributing to this confusion it is important to avoid making normative claims when none are intended.},

abstract = {Paying taxes can be considered a contribution to the welfare of a society. But even though tax payments are redistributed to citizens in the form of public goods and services, taxpayers often do not perceive many benefits from paying taxes. Information campaigns about the use of taxes for financing public goods and services could increase taxpayers' understanding of the importance of taxes, strengthen their perception of fiscal exchange and consequently also increase tax compliance. Two studies examined how fit between framing of information and taxpayers' regulatory focus affects perceived fiscal exchange and tax compliance. Taxpayers should perceive the exchange between tax payments and provision of public goods and services as higher if information framing suits their regulatory focus. Study 1 supported this hypothesis for induced regulatory focus. Study 2 replicated the findings for chronic regulatory focus and further demonstrated that regulatory fit also affects tax compliance. The results provide further evidence for findings from previous studies concerning regulatory fit effects on tax attitudes and extend these findings to a context with low tax morale.},

abstract = {Previous proactivity research has predominantly assumed that proactive personality generates positive environmental changes in the workplace. Grounded in recent research on personality development from a broad interactionist theoretical approach, the present article investigates whether work characteristics, including job demands, job control, social support from supervisors and coworkers, and organizational constraints, change proactive personality over time and, more important, reciprocal relationships between proactive personality and work characteristics. Latent change score analyses based on longitudinal data collected in 3 waves across 3 years show that job demands and job control have positive lagged effects on increases in proactive personality. In addition, proactive personality exerts beneficial lagged effects on increases in job demands, job control, and supervisory support, and on decreases in organizational constraints. Dynamic reciprocal relationships are observed between proactive personality with job demands and job control. The revealed corresponsive change relationships between proactive personality and work characteristics contribute to the proactive personality literature by illuminating more nuanced interplays between the agentic person and work characteristics, and also have important practical implications for organizations and employees.

abstract = {Decisions take time, and as a rule more difficult decisions take more time. But this only raises the question of what consumes the time. For decisions informed by a sequence of samples of evidence, the answer is straightforward: more samples are available with more time. Indeed, the speed and accuracy of such decisions are explained by the accumulation of evidence to a threshold or bound. However, the same framework seems to apply to decisions that are not obviously informed by sequences of evidence samples. Here, we proffer the hypothesis that the sequential character of such tasks involves retrieval of evidence from memory. We explore this hypothesis by focusing on value-based decisions and argue that mnemonic processes can account for regularities in choice and decision time. We speculate on the neural mechanisms that link sampling of evidence from memory to circuits that represent the accumulated evidence bearing on a choice. We propose that memory processes may contribute to a wider class of decisions that conform to the regularities of choice-reaction time predicted by the sequential sampling framework.},

To test these predictions, the authors assessed the effects of these motor actions on 3 central elements of creative insight: contextual set-breaking, restructuring, and mental search. As predicted, in 6 experiments, arm flexion, relative to arm extension, facilitated insight-related processes. In a 7th experiment, arm extension, relative to arm flexion, facilitated analytical reasoning, supporting a cognitive tuning interpretation of the findings.},

Findings suggest that risk seeking becomes a motivational necessity under 3 conditions: (a) when an individual is in a state of loss; (b) when the individual is in a prevention-focused regulatory state (E. T. Higgins, 1997); and (c) when the risky option alone offers the possibility of eliminating loss. In situations involving loss, prevention motivation but not promotion motivation (whether measured or manipulated) was uniquely associated with behaviors that served the motivation to maintain the status quo. When the risky option offered the sole possibility of returning to the status quo, prevention motivation predicted increased risk seeking. However, when a more conservative option was available that also offered the possibility to return to the status quo, prevention motivation predicted risk aversion. When neither option offered the possibility to return to the status quo, prevention motivation was not associated with risky choice. The authors discuss the benefits of complementing existing accounts of risky decision making under loss with regulatory focus motivational mechanisms.},

abstract = {Bayes factors provide a symmetrical measure of evidence for one model versus another (e.g. H1 versus H0) in order to relate theory to data. These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P-values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B-hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).},

This is because people pursuing a goal (e.g., become kinder) usually invest efforts in whichever means (e.g., donate to a particular charity) they perceive as most instrumental for attaining their goal. Consequently, in their minds there is a correspondence between instrumentality of a means and feelings of effort. This correspondence becomes reversed in peoples minds during goal pursuit, and they also come to view an object that is associated with feelings of effort rather than ease as more instrumental for goal attainment and consequently more desirable. When an object is not a means to fulfill an accessible goal, or when goals relating to the means are not accessible, subjective feelings of ease improve evaluation, as found in previous research on ease of processing.},

Recently, choice response time models have become more accessible through the release of user-friendly software for estimating their parameters. The aim of this tutorial is to provide guidance about the process of using these parameter estimates and associated model fits to make conclusions about experimental data. We use an application of one response time model, the linear ballistic accumulator, as an example to demonstrate the steps required to select an appropriate parametric characterization of a data set.

abstract = {Future unmanned systems in the military will be highly heterogeneous in nature, with vehicles from multiple domains—aerial, underwater, and land—working in collaborative teams to complete a variety of missions. The complexity of supervising these teams will be enormous and will rely on human creativity, judgment, and experience. Therefore, the design and development of mission planning and monitoring technologies must be rooted in a deep understanding of the human operator's role as mission manager, and must effectively address the reasoning skills and limitations of both the human and autonomous intelligent system. In this paper we present our work to approach these supervisory issues from a human-centered perspective. We first review the findings of a cognitive task analysis, through which we defined critical informational requirements and developed display interfaces for human operators developing and executing mission plans for a small team of underwater and aerial unmanned vehicles. These findings raise several operations issues for unmanned vehicle management, namely (1) vehicle and task heterogeneity and (2) the coordination of command and control across a vehicle team. We discuss the impact of both of these design requirements on the human-centered development of mission planning tools for unmanned systems. Finally, we introduce an investigative approach to support the rapid evaluation of interfaces that flexibly accommodate alternative command and control philosophies for heterogeneous automated systems using a combination of modeling and human-in-the-loop evaluation processes.},

It was hypothesized that cognitive failure would directly predict safety behavior and workplace accidents and predict these outcomes over and above conscientiousness. It was found that cognitive failure uniquely accounted for workplace safety behavior and accidents. However, it has been suggested by researchers that certain individual differences might interact to produce differential effects. Thus, a moderated model was tested examining the interaction of cognitive failure and conscientiousness. It was found that cognitive failure moderated the relationship between conscientiousness and accidents and unsafe work behaviors. Overall, results suggest that cognitive failure plays an important part in individual safety behavior, especially when conscientiousness is low.},

We investigated neural correlates of loss aversion while individuals decided whether to accept or reject gambles that offered a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money. A broad set of areas (including midbrain dopaminergic regions and their targets) showed increasing activity as potential gains increased. Potential losses were represented by decreasing activity in several of these same gain-sensitive areas. Finally, individual differences in behavioral loss aversion were predicted by a measure of neural loss aversion in several regions, including the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex.},

Research reviewed in this article probes the control processes that reconfigure mental resources for a change of task by requiring subjects to switch frequently among a small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses are substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone immediately after a task switch. This 'switch cost' is reduced, but not eliminated, by an opportunity for preparation. It seems to result from both transient and long-term carry-over of 'task-set' activation and inhibition as well as time consumed by task-set reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging studies of task switching have revealed extra activation in numerous brain regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate 'controlling' from 'controlled' regions.},

abstract = {From a behavioral viewpoint, people choose where to live based on various factors, including their current situations, past experience, and plans for the future. Some aspects of residential preference might be constant over time, inherited from the initial stage of life, and other parts might be responses to residential biography or other biographical domains like household structure, employment/education, and travel. Capturing these intertemporal dependences needs a life course analysis of residential location choices. However, a serious methodological gap exists between the perceived importance of dynamic life course analyses and quantitative modeling approaches. This study developed a dynamic choice model with cross-sectional and longitudinal heterogeneities as well as discounted utility (called the DU-DCLH model) to describe the decision-making process for residential relocation by incorporating various intertemporal dependences over the life course. Model parameters were estimated using data collected from a life history survey conducted in Japan in 2010. The estimation results firstly confirm the effectiveness of the DU-DCLH model for portraying the dynamics of residential mobility over a life course. Next, it was found that previous experiences dominate decisions on residential location choice and can explain more than 75{\%} of the total variations in choice. It was also revealed that as the mobility age increases, the influence of the past on their choices increases continuously. In contrast, the influence of the present situation is small and almost negligible. Furthermore, the study empirically confirmed not only the influence of time-constant and time-varying preference for residential neighborhoods but also the specific influence of household biography, employment/education biography, and travel biography. This study enriches the existing research by providing a systematic modeling framework incorporating broader behavioral mechanisms for residential location choice over the life course.},

As hypothesized, a complex 3-way interaction was observed among environmental volatility, relative progress, and time on resource allocation. When goal progress was determined only by the performers' actions (low environmental volatility), greater time was allocated to the least discrepant goal early on and to the most discrepant goal toward the end of available time. In contrast, when goal progress was also influenced by unpredictable external factors (high environmental volatility), greater time was allocated to the most discrepant goal early on and to the least discrepant goal as the deadline neared. Individual differences in goal orientation further influenced this relationship within a volatile context, with these relationships also varying across time. Under such conditions, those with a strong mastery orientation allocated more time to toward the most discrepant task, whereas those with a strong avoidance orientation allocated more time to the goal closest to being attained. The implications for theory and research on dynamic time allocation are discussed.},

Specifically, we predicted that enactment of approach behavior would broaden attentional scope, engendering a focus upon global perceptual structure and facilitating conceptual access to mental representations with lower a priori accessibility, whereas enactment of avoidance behavior would constrict attentional scope, engendering a focus upon local perceptual details and "choking off" conceptual access to mental representations with lower a priori accessibility.

Individual factors are those that vary from person to person: the relevance of the performance dimension, the similarity of rivals, and their relationship closeness to the individual, as well as the various individual differences variables relating to social comparison more generally. Situational factors, conversely, are those factors on the social comparison landscape that affect similarly situated individuals: proximity to a standard (i.e., near the number 1 ranking vs. far away), the number of competitors (i.e., few vs. many), social category fault lines (i.e., disputes across vs. within social categories), and more.

Here, we show that if a large crowd is structured in small independent groups, deliberation and social influence within groups improve the crowd's collective accuracy. We asked a live crowd (N=5180) to respond to general-knowledge questions (e.g., what is the height of the Eiffel Tower?). Participants first answered individually, then deliberated and made consensus decisions in groups of five, and finally provided revised individual estimates. We found that averaging consensus decisions was substantially more accurate than aggregating the initial independent opinions. Remarkably, combining as few as four consensus choices outperformed the wisdom of thousands of individuals.},

Experiment 2 replicated this finding with a different type of implicit goals. Experiment 3 found that primed implicit goals had no effect on choices where the options that served them undermined the explicit goal. Experiment 4 found that a primed implicit goal served by a multifinal option does not privilege it over a unifinal option if that goal had been already attained by a different means. Finally, Experiment 5, via 3 types of control groups, showed that choices were affected by both the explicit and implicit goals in isolation, and they shifted toward multifinality when these goals were conjointly present. The discussion considers the integrative potential of the multifinality framework and its implications for a variety of phenomena in the domain of motivated cognition.},

abstract = {Goal-setting theory is one of the most researched and practically applied theories in the field of organizational behavior. A core tenet of this theory is that specific and challenging goals increase performance. However, recent behavioral ethics research has left unresolved questions regarding how high performance goals can be used to motivate performance without also encouraging unethical behavior. Drawing on achievement goal theory, we consider the role of goal type in arguing that an over-use of outcome goals as performance drivers and an over-reliance on goal difficulty as a motivating mechanism have both created goal-setting's dark side and obscured potential remedies. Extending previous research, we integrate the goal-setting literature with regulatory focus theory to demonstrate that outcome goals stimulate a prevention focus, which increases unethical behavior as individuals engage in questionable conduct in order to prevent goal failure. This indirect effect is exacerbated as goal difficulty increases. In contrast to outcome goals, learning goals reduce prevention focus and unethical behavior without decreasing performance—even when goals are difficult. Across both field and laboratory studies, we find convergent support for our proposed model. Our findings extend existing theory and also offer practical insight into harnessing the motivating power of goals without simultaneously increasing unethicality.},

abstract = {We develop a new model for flexible workforce management in environments with uncertainty in the demand for labor. In particular we model a workforce comprised of regular workers who have fixed schedules and may work overtime, and contingent workers whose working hours are flexible as specified by a contract over a finite planning horizon. Our model can represent a variety of contracts, including: temporary workers, on-call workers with guaranteed minimum pay, and comp-time arrangements. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that determines the regular and contingent worker pool sizes that minimize expected labor and backlog costs. Embedded within this problem is a dynamic programming problem of making optimal operational staffing decisions with respect to the utilization of contingent and overtime resources. Numerical examples demonstrate the effect that the timing of information has on the benefits of flexibility. We also derive structural results that may be exploited to reduce the computational effort required to use the model. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A quantitative, physiology-based model of the ascending arousal system is developed, using continuum neuronal population modeling, which involves averaging properties such as firing rates across neurons in each population. The model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), where circadian and homeostatic drives enter the system, the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of the ascending arousal system, and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by the activities of these nuclei, which modulate the behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables. Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with physiological and behavioral measures, and the model replicates the human sleep-wake cycle, with physiologically reasonable voltages and firing rates. Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and sleep-promoting VLPO causes ''flip-flop'' behavior, with most time spent in 2 stable steady states corresponding to wake and sleep, with transitions between them on a timescale of a few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the sleep-wake cycle, with a region of bistability of the wake and sleep states. Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhi-bition results in a smaller hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in both directions and makes the states less distin-guishable, as in narcolepsy. The model behavior is robust across the con-strained parameter ranges, but with sufficient flexibility to describe a wide range of observed phenomena.},

abstract = {The linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model (Brown {\&} Heathcote, , Cogn. Psychol., 57, 153) is increasingly popular in modelling response times from experimental data. An R package, glba, has been developed to fit the LBA model using maximum likelihood estimation which is validated by means of a parameter recovery study. At sufficient sample sizes parameter recovery is good, whereas at smaller sample sizes there can be large bias in parameters. In a second simulation study, two methods for computing parameter standard errors are compared. The Hessian-based method is found to be adequate and is (much) faster than the alternative bootstrap method. The use of parameter standard errors in model selection and inference is illustrated in an example using data from an implicit learning experiment (Visser et al., , Mem. Cogn., 35, 1502). It is shown that typical implicit learning effects are captured by different parameters of the LBA model. },

The evidence supports the view that anger relates to an appetitive or approach motivational system, whereas anxiety relates to an aversive or avoidance motivational system. This evidence appears to have 2 implications. One implication concerns the nature of anterior cortical asymmetry effects. The evidence suggests that such asymmetry reflects direction of motivational engagement (approach vs. withdrawal) rather than affective valence. The other implication concerns the idea that affects form a purely positive dimension and a purely negative dimension, which reflect the operation of appetitive and aversive motivational systems, respectively. The evidence reviewed does not support that view. The evidence is, however, consistent with a discrete-emotions view (which does not rely on dimensionality) and with an alternative dimensional approach.},

abstract = {Studies of social judgments have demonstrated a number of diverse phenomena that were so far difficult to explain within a single theoretical framework. Prominent examples are false consensus and false uniqueness, as well as self-enhancement and self-depreciation. Here we show that these seemingly complex phenomena can be a product of an interplay between basic cognitive processes and the structure of social and task environments. We propose and test a new process model of social judgment, the social sampling model (SSM), which provides a parsimonious quantitative account of different types of social judgments. In the SSM, judgments about characteristics of broader social environments are based on sampling of social instances from memory, where instances receive activation if they belong to a target reference class and have a particular characteristic. These sampling processes interact with the properties of social and task environments, including homophily, shapes of frequency distributions, and question formats. For example, in line with the model's predictions we found that whether false consensus or false uniqueness will occur depends on the level of homophily in people's social circles and on the way questions are asked. The model also explains some previously unaccounted-for patterns of self-enhancement and self-depreciation. People seem to be well informed about many characteristics of their immediate social circles, which in turn influence how they evaluate broader social environments and their position within them. Social judgments are ubiquitous in everyday life and form the basis for many aspects of social cognition: social comparison to determine one's own relative performance and establish personal goals (" How many of my colleagues have a higher income than I have? "), social learning about the value of unknown options (" How many other people with diabetes have bought this type of health insurance? "), formation of social norms and values (" How many other students drink more than I do? " or " How many of my family members support this political party? "), coordination (" How many other drivers will take the same route to the city center? "), and cooperation (" How many other people in the general population recycle? "). The central goal of the present work is to provide a better understanding of the cognitive processes under-lying such judgments. There is a large literature in social psychology on different phenomena associated with social judgment, sometimes leaving an impression that social cognition is fraught with biases that prevent people from fully understanding and adapting to their social envi-ronments (Krueger {\&} Funder, 2004). Prominent examples are false consensus (where endorsers of a particular view believe that this view is more common than nonendorsers believe), false unique-ness (where endorsers of a particular view believe that this view is less common than nonendorsers believe), self-enhancement (where people overestimate their performance relative to others), and self-depreciation (where people underestimate their performance relative to others). Past accounts of these effects have mostly focused on cognitive and motivational processes within the mind. However, seemingly complex phenomena can be a product of an interplay between minds and their social and task environments},

abstract = {Although goal progress is often hypothesized to be positively linked to well-being, existing research points to an inconsistent relationship and suggests that potential moderators need to be examined. This longitudinal study investigated whether 2 aspects of goal cognition-goal attainability and self-efficacy-influence the relationship between goal progress and well-being (viz., job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion) in a sample of 172 nurses. Work goal progress was not directly associated with well-being. Rather, the link between goal progress and well-being was moderated by goal cognition. Individuals who started off with unfavorable goal cognitions but who managed to achieve goal progress reported an increase in well-being, compared with those who had favorable goal cognitions and similar rates of progress. Progress appears to have compensated for low initial goal cognition in the prediction of well-being, and high initial goal cognition appears to have undermined this predictive relationship. Also, goal progress was associated with an increase in self-efficacy and goal attainability from Time 1 to Time 2. Results are discussed in relation to goal theories and the concept of self-correcting goal cycles.},

However, we argue that this is not always the case. In this article, we show that motivation to engage in goal-consistent behavior can be higher when people are either far from or close to the end state and lower when they are about halfway to the end state. We propose a psychophysical explanation for this tendency to get "stuck in the middle." Building on the assumption that motivation is influenced by the perceived marginal value of progress toward the goal, we show that the shape of the goal gradient varies depending on whether an individual monitors progress in terms of distance from the initial state or from the desired end state.

abstract = {In experimental science, it is desirable to hold all fac-tors constant except those intentionally manipulated. In psychology, however, this ideal is often not possible. El-ements such as participants and items vary, in addition to the intended factors. For example, a researcher interested in the psychology of reading might manipulate the part of speech and observe reading times. In this case, there is unintended variability from the selection of both par-ticipants and items. In his classic article, " The Language-as-Fixed-Effect Fallacy: A Critique of Language Statis-tics in Psychological Research, " H. H. Clark (1973) discussed how unintended variability from the simulta-neous selection of participants and items leads to under-estimation of confidence intervals and inflation of Type I error rates in conventional analysis. Type I error rate in-flation, or an increased tendency to find a significant ef-fect when none exists, is highly undesirable. To demonstrate the problem, consider the question of whether nouns and verbs are read at the same rate. To an-swer this question, a researcher could randomly select suitable verbs and nouns and ask a number of partici-pants to read them. Each participant produces a set of reading time scores for both nouns and verbs. A common approach is to tabulate for each participant one mean reading time for nouns and another for verbs. To test the hypothesis of the equality of reading rates, these pairs of mean reading times may be submitted to paired t tests. This analytic approach is often used in memory research. For example, Riefer and Rouder (1992) used this analy-sis to determine whether bizarre sentences are better re-membered than common ones. Clark (1973), however, argued that using t tests to analyze means tabulated across different items leads to Type I error rate inflation. In the following demonstration, we show by simulation that this inflation is not only real, but also surprisingly large. We generate data for a standard ANOVA-style model (discussed below) with no part-of-speech effects. We analyze these data by first computing participant means for each part of speech and then submitting these means to a paired t test. This process is performed re-peatedly, and the proportion of significant results is re-ported. If the test has no Type I error inflation, the pro-portion should be the nominal Type I error rate, which is set to the conventional value of .05. Consider the following ANOVA-style model for nouns: It is reasonable to expect that each participant has a unique effect on reading time; some participants are fast at read-ing, but others are slow. This effect for the ith participant 573},

Ss expressed the degree of time pressure they experienced and goal difficulty was assessed through supervisory ratings. Results somewhat supported Hypothesis 1 and Parkinson's Law, which suggests that work will expand or contract to fill the amount of time available for it. Goal difficulty was supported as a mediating condition. It is suggested that time pressure is an effective means of impacting upon the difficulty of goals held by persons at work and their level of performance.

abstract = {Decision-makers effortlessly balance the need for urgency against the need for caution. Theoretical and neurophysiological accounts have explained this tradeoff solely in terms of the quantity of evidence required to trigger a decision (the “threshold”). This explanation has also been used as a benchmark test for evaluating new models of decision-making, but the explanation itself has not been carefully tested against data. We rigorously test the assumption that emphasizing decision speed vs. decision accuracy selectively influences only decision thresholds. In data from a new brightness discrimination experiment we found that emphasising decision speed over decision accuracy not only decreases the amount of evidence required for a decision, but also decreases the quality of information being accumulated during the decision process. This result was consistent for two leading decision-making models, and in a model- free test. We also found the same model-based results in archival data from a lexical decision task (reported by Wagenmakers et al. 2008) and new data from a recognition memory task. We discuss implications for theoretical development, and applications.},

Meta-analyses link optimism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to more engagement coping; neuroticism to more disengagement coping; and optimism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness to less disengagement coping. Relations of traits to specific coping responses reveal a more nuanced picture. Several moderators of these associations also emerge: age, stressor severity, and temporal proximity between the coping activity and the coping report. Personality and coping play both independent and interactive roles in influencing physical and mental health.

abstract = {This paper presents a simple formal-analytical model delivering qualitative predictions for re-sponse times in binary-choice experiments. It combines a dual-process/multi-strategy approach with the standard diffusion model, modeling a utility decision process and a heuristic decision process as diffusion processes of evidence accumulation. For experiments with objective al-ternatives (including many tasks in judgment and decision making), the model predicts that errors will be quicker than correct responses in case of process conflict and slower in case of alignment, capturing a well-documented asymmetry regarding slow or fast errors. Further, the model also predicts that correct responses are slower in case of conflict than in case of align-ment, capturing the well-known Stroop effect. The model is also extended to cover experiments with subjective alternative evaluations, i.e., preferential choice. In this case, results depend on whether trials are hard or easy, i.e., on whether the heuristic can be interpreted as relatively automatic or not. Response times are a central tool for the study of psy-chological processes underlying human decisions. They are especially important in two-alternative choice experiments, which in turn are ubiquitous in several branches of psychol-ogy. Many formal-analytical models have been developed to account for regularities in the data, one of the most prominent thereof being the diffusion model of evidence accumulation (Ratcliff, 1978, 2013; Ratcliff {\&} Rouder, 1998; Smith, 2000). This model has harvested many successes, chief among them being able to account for the speed-accuracy trade-off (Wick-elgren, 1977).

Codifying what constitutes appropriate use of these models will be increasingly important over the next decade. Current guide-lines for determining a safe working time arrangement based on model outputs generally use a single upper threshold and are, arguably, over-simplistic. These guidelines fail to incorporate explicitly essen-tial aspects of the risk assessment process – namely, the inherent uncertainty and variability in human sleep–wake behavior; the non-linear relationship between fatigue, task performance and safety out-comes; the consequence of a fatigue-related error and its influence on overall risk; and the impact of risk mitigation or controls in reducing the likelihood or consequence of a fatigue-related error. As industry and regulatory bodies increasingly move toward performance-based approaches to safety management, any fatigue risk management system that includes a bio-mathematical model should specify what exactly is measured by the model, and how the model can be used in the context of a safety management system approach. This will require significant dialog between the various parties with an interest in bio-mathematical models, i.e. developers, vendors, end-users, and regulators.},

This paper describes a research paradigm designed to examine directly the dynamics of micro-meso - individual, dyad, and team - emergent phenomena. We identify, describe, and illustrate the sequence of theoretical, measurement, computational, data analytic, and systematic research activities that are necessary to operationalize and utilize the paradigm. We illustrate the paradigm development process using our research, focused on learning and team knowledge emergence, and highlight key design principles that can be applied to examine other emergent phenomena in teams. We conclude with a discussion of contributions, strengths and limitations, and generalization of the approach to other emergent phenomena in teams.},

The authors predicted that when a victim's regulatory focus (i.e., promotion vs. prevention) was congruent (i.e., fit) with the regulatory focus of a transgressor's repentance (i.e., promotion vs. prevention), there would be greater forgiveness compared with when there was incongruence (i.e., mismatch). Three studies supported these predictions. The results also confirmed one potential explanation for why apologies are not always successful at eliciting forgiveness, namely, feeling right. This research suggests that regulatory focus theory can help inform the scientific study of forgiveness and its related processes.},

The underlying cognitive processes were investigated by testing six sets of hypotheses concerning choices, decision times, and information search derived from cumulative prospect theory, decision field theory, priority heuristic and parallel constraint satis- faction models. Our participants completed 40 decision tasks of two gambles with two non-negative outcomes each. Information search was recorded using eye-tracking technology. Results for choices, decision time, the amount of information searched for, fixation durations, the direction of the information search, and the distribution of fixations conflict with the prediction of the non-compensatory priority heuristic and indicate that individuals use compensatory strategies. Choice proportions are well in line with the predictions of cumulative prospect theory. Process measures indicate that individuals thereby do not rely on deliberate calculations of weighted sums. Information integration processes seem to be better explained by models that partially rely on automatic processes such as decision field theory or parallel constraint satisfaction models.},

Self-regulation can be undermined by failures to transcend overwhelming temptations, negative moods and resource depletion, and when minor lapses in self-control snowball into self-regulatory collapse. Cognitive neuroscience research suggests that successful self-regulation is dependent on top-down control from the prefrontal cortex over subcortical regions involved in reward and emotion. We highlight recent neuroimaging research on self-regulatory failure, the findings of which support a balance model of self-regulation whereby self-regulatory failure occurs whenever the balance is tipped in favor of subcortical areas, either due to particularly strong impulses or when prefrontal function itself is impaired. Such a model is consistent with recent findings in the cognitive neuroscience of addictive behavior, emotion regulation and decision-making. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {PROBLEM: In construction, the challenge for researchers and practitioners is to develop work systems (production processes and teams) that can achieve high productivity and high safety at the same time. However, construction accident causation models ignore the role of work practices and teamwork. This study investigates the mechanisms by which production and teamwork practices affect the likelihood of accidents.

METHOD: The paper synthesizes a new model for construction safety based on the cognitive perspective (Fuller's Task-Demand-Capability Interface model, 2005) and then presents an exploratory case study. The case study investigates and compares the work practices of two residential framing crews: a 'High Reliability Crew' (HRC)--that is, a crew with exceptional productivity and safety over several years, and an average performing crew from the same company.

RESULTS: The model explains how the production and teamwork practices generate the work situations that workers face (the task demands) and affect the workers ability to cope (capabilities). The case study indicates that the work practices of the HRC directly influence the task demands and match them with the applied capabilities. These practices were guided by the 'principle' of avoiding errors and rework and included work planning and preparation, work distribution, managing the production pressures, and quality and behavior monitoring.

SUMMARY: The Task Demand-Capability model links construction research to a cognitive model of accident causation and provides a new way to conceptualize safety as an emergent property of the production practices and teamwork processes. The empirical evidence indicates that the crews' work practices and team processes strongly affect the task demands, the applied capabilities, and the match between demands and capabilities.

IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: The proposed model and the exploratory case study will guide further discovery of work practices and teamwork processes that can increase both productivity and safety in construction operations. Such understanding will enable training of construction foremen and crews in these practices to systematically develop high reliability crews.},

abstract = {Improved experimental techniques for the study of condi-tioning and simple discrimination learning enable the present day investigator to obtain data which are sufficiently orderly and reproducible to support exact quantitative predictions of behavior. Analogy with other sciences suggests that full utiliza-tion of these techniques in the analysis of learning processes will depend to some extent upon a comparable refinement of theoretical concepts and methods. The necessary interplay be-tween theory and experiment has been hindered, however, by the fact that none of the many current theories of learning com-mands general agreement among researchers. It seems likely that progress toward a common frame of reference will be slow so long as most theories are built around verbally defined hypo-thetical constructs which are not susceptible to unequivocal verification. While awaiting resolution of the many apparent disparities among competing theories, it may be advantageous to systematize well established empirical relationships at a pe-ripheral, statistical level of analysis. The possibility of agreement on a theoretical framework, at least in certain inten-sively studied areas, may be maximized by defining concepts in terms of experimentally manipulable variables, and developing the consequences of assumptions by strict mathematical rea-soning. This essay will introduce a series of studies developing a sta-tistical theory of elementary learning processes. From the defi-nitions and assumptions which appear necessary for this kind of formulation, we shall attempt to derive relations among com-monly used measures of behavior and quantitative expressions describing various simple learning phenomena. Preliminary Considerations Since propositions concerning psychological events are veri-fiable only to the extent that they are reducible to predictions of behavior under specified environmental conditions, it appears likely that greatest economy and consistency in theoretical structure will result from the statement of all fundamental laws in the form R =/(• ?),},

abstract = {Sleep is essential for the maintenance of the brain and the body, yet many features of sleep are poorly understood and mathematical models are an important tool for probing proposed biological mechanisms. The most well-known mathematical model of sleep regulation, the two-process model, models the sleep-wake cycle by two oscillators: a circadian oscillator and a homeostatic oscillator. An alternative, more recent, model considers the mutual inhibition of sleep promoting neurons and the ascending arousal system regulated by homeostatic and circadian processes. Here we show there are fundamental similarities between these two models. The implications are illustrated with two important sleep-wake phenomena. Firstly, we show that in the two-process model, transitions between different numbers of daily sleep episodes can be classified as grazing bifurcations. This provides the theoretical underpinning for numerical results showing that the sleep patterns of many mammals can be explained by the mutual inhibition model. Secondly, we show that when sleep deprivation disrupts the sleep-wake cycle, ostensibly different measures of sleepiness in the two models are closely related. The demonstration of the mathematical similarities of the two models is valuable because not only does it allow some features of the two-process model to be interpreted physiologically but it also means that knowledge gained from study of the two-process model can be used to inform understanding of the behaviour of the mutual inhibition model. This is important because the mutual inhibition model and its extensions are increasingly being used as a tool to understand a diverse range of sleep-wake phenomena such as the design of optimal shift-patterns, yet the values it uses for parameters associated with the circadian and homeostatic processes are very different from those that have been experimentally measured in the context of the two-process model.},

abstract = {The world is full of complex environments in which individuals must plan a series of choices to obtain some desired outcome. In these situations entire sequences of events, including one's future decisions, should be considered before taking an action. Backward induction provides a normative strategy for planning, in which one works backward, deterministically, from the end of a scenario. However, it often fails to account for human behavior. I propose an alternative account, Decision Field Theory-Planning, in which individuals plan future choices on the fly through repeated mental simulations. A key prediction of DFT-P is that payoff variability produces noisy simulations and reduces sensitivity to utility differences. In two multistage risky decision tree experiments I obtained this payoff variability effect, with choice proportions moving toward 0.50 as variability increased. I showed that DFT-P provides valuable insight into the strategies that people used to plan future choices and allocate cognitive resources across decision stages.

abstract = {Objective: Assess team performance within a net-worked supervisory control setting while manipulating automated decision aids and monitoring team communica-tion and working memory ability. Background: Networked systems such as multi– unmanned air vehicle (UAV) supervision have complex properties that make prediction of human-system perfor-mance difficult. Automated decision aid can provide valu-able information to operators, individual abilities can limit or facilitate team performance, and team communication patterns can alter how effectively individuals work together. We hypothesized that reliable automation, higher working memory capacity, and increased communication rates of task-relevant information would offset performance decre-ments attributed to high task load. Method: Two-person teams performed a simulated air defense task with two levels of task load and three levels of automated aid reliability. Teams communicated and received decision aid messages via chat window text messages. Results: Task Load × Automation effects were signifi-cant across all performance measures. Reliable automation limited the decline in team performance with increasing task load. Average team spatial working memory was a stronger predictor than other measures of team working memory. Frequency of team rapport and enemy location communi-cations positively related to team performance, and word count was negatively related to team performance. Conclusion: Reliable decision aiding mitigated team performance decline during increased task load dur-ing multi-UAV supervisory control. Team spatial working memory, communication of spatial information, and team rapport predicted team success. Application: An automated decision aid can improve team performance under high task load. Assessment of spa-tial working memory and the communication of task-rele-vant information can help in operator and team selection in supervisory control systems.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The two-process model of sleep regulation makes accurate predictions of sleep timing and duration for a variety of experimental sleep deprivation and nap sleep scenarios. Upon extending its application to waking neurobehavioral performance, however, the model fails to predict the effects of chronic sleep restriction. Here we show that the two-process model belongs to a broader class of models formulated in terms of coupled non-homogeneous first-order ordinary differential equations, which have a dynamic repertoire capturing waking neurobehavioral functions across a wide range of wake/sleep schedules. We examine a specific case of this new model class, and demonstrate the existence of a bifurcation: for daily amounts of wakefulness less than a critical threshold, neurobehavioral performance is predicted to converge to an asymptotically stable state of equilibrium; whereas for daily wakefulness extended beyond the critical threshold, neurobehavioral performance is predicted to diverge from an unstable state of equilibrium. Comparison of model simulations to laboratory observations of lapses of attention on a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), in experiments on the effects of chronic sleep restriction and acute total sleep deprivation, suggests that this bifurcation is an essential feature of performance impairment due to sleep loss. We present three new predictions that may be experimentally verified to validate the model. These predictions, if confirmed, challenge conventional notions about the effects of sleep and sleep loss on neurobehavioral performance. The new model class implicates a biological system analogous to two connected compartments containing interacting compounds with time-varying concentrations as being a key mechanism for the regulation of psychomotor vigilance as a function of sleep loss. We suggest that the adenosinergic neuromodulator/receptor system may provide the underlying neurobiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Lewandowsky2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among American Conservatives, but not Liberals, trust in science has been declining since the 1970's. Climate science has become particularly polarized, with Conservatives being more likely than Liberals to reject the notion that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the globe. Conversely, opposition to genetically-modified (GM) foods and vaccinations is often ascribed to the political Left although reliable data are lacking. There are also growing indications that rejection of science is suffused by conspiracist ideation, that is the general tendency to endorse conspiracy theories including the specific beliefs that inconvenient scientific findings constitute a "hoax."

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a propensity weighted internet-panel survey of the U.S. population and show that conservatism and free-market worldview strongly predict rejection of climate science, in contrast to their weaker and opposing effects on acceptance of vaccinations. The two worldview variables do not predict opposition to GM. Conspiracist ideation, by contrast, predicts rejection of all three scientific propositions, albeit to greatly varying extents. Greater endorsement of a diverse set of conspiracy theories predicts opposition to GM foods, vaccinations, and climate science.

CONCLUSIONS: Free-market worldviews are an important predictor of the rejection of scientific findings that have potential regulatory implications, such as climate science, but not necessarily of other scientific issues. Conspiracist ideation, by contrast, is associated with the rejection of all scientific propositions tested. We highlight the manifold cognitive reasons why conspiracist ideation would stand in opposition to the scientific method. The involvement of conspiracist ideation in the rejection of science has implications for science communicators.},

In this article, we establish the role of competitive pressures for the facilitation of optimal decision making in simple sequential binary choice tasks. In two experiments, competition was introduced with a computerized opponent whose choice behavior reinforced one of two strategies: If the opponent probabilistically imitated partici-pant choices, probability matching was optimal; if the opponent was indifferent, probability maximizing was optimal. We observed accurate asymptotic strategy use in both conditions irrespective of the provision of outcome probabilities, suggesting that participants were sensitive to the differences in opponent behavior. An analysis of reinforcement learning models established that computational conceptualizations of opponent behavior are critical to account for the observed divergence in strategy adoption. Our results pro-vide a novel appraisal of probability matching and show how this individually 'irrational' choice phenomenon can be socially adap-tive under competition.},

abstract = {Conditioning, how animals learn to associate two or more events, is one of the most influential para-digms in learning theory. It is nev-ertheless unclear how current models of associative learning can accommodate complex phe-nomena without ad hoc represen-tational assumptions. We propose to embrace deep neural networks to negotiate this problem. Associative learning describes how two or more events (be they stimuli or responses) become associated (Box 1 [ 8 6 {\_} T D {\$} D I F F ] and Figure 1). This deceptively simple idea is one of the fundamental pillars in the study of learning and cognition. It has been proven to oper-ate at both behavioural and neural levels, with a wide range of procedures and organisms, and to underlie higher-order cognitive processes (rule learning and concept formation). The rules of associa-tion formation may be simple but the world upon which they operate is not necessarily so. We argue that whereas models of associative learning often assume an arbitrary connectionist archi-tecture, using deep networks to learn stimulus representations would allow for biologically plausible, hierarchical repre-sentations, better model comparison, and ultimately more accurate predictive models of learning. Although there is an on-going debate on the explanatory power of associative learning theory [1], recent studies on the neural bases of trial and error learning [2], and the role of associative learning in evolutionary biol-ogy [3] and social interaction [4] seem to bolster the status of associative learning as one of the cardinal paradigms in behavioural neurosciences. The crux of the controversy nonetheless does not question experimental evidence, of which plenty exists, but whether such evidence is supported by current models within the terms of reference of traditional associa-tive learning theory[ 8 7 {\_} T D {\$} D I F F ] .},

abstract = {Humans display a trait-like response to sleep loss. However, it is not known whether this trait-like response can be captured by a mathematical model from only one sleep-loss condition to facilitate neurobehavioural performance prediction of the same individual during a different sleep-loss condition. In this paper, we investigated the extent to which the recently developed unified mathematical model of performance (UMP) captured such trait-like features for different sleep-loss conditions. We used the UMP to develop two sets of individual-specific models for 15 healthy adults who underwent two different sleep-loss challenges (order counterbalanced; separated by 2-4 weeks): (i) 64 h of total sleep deprivation (TSD) and (ii) chronic sleep restriction (CSR) of 7 days of 3 h nightly time in bed. We then quantified the extent to which models developed using psychomotor vigilance task data under TSD predicted performance data under CSR, and vice versa. The results showed that the models customized to an individual under one sleep-loss condition accurately predicted performance of the same individual under the other condition, yielding, on average, up to 50{\%} improvement over non-individualized, group-average model predictions. This finding supports the notion that the UMP captures an individual's trait-like response to different sleep-loss conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 European Sleep Research Society.},

When familiarity and sensitivity were low, participants in a regulatory fit (promotion focus with gains or a prevention focus with losses) showed greater perceptual sensitivity but no response bias differences, relative to participants in a regulatory mismatch. When familiarity and sensitivity were high, participants in a regulatory fit showed a response bias toward the high-payoff stimulus but no differences in perceptual sensitivity.

abstract = {This paper starts by summarizing the development and refinement of the additive three-process model of alertness first published by Folkard and Akerstedt in 1987. It reviews some of the successes that have been achieved by the model in not only predicting variations in subjective alertness on abnormal sleep-wake schedules but also in accounting for objective measures of sleep latency and duration. Nevertheless, predictions derived from the model concerning alertness on different shifts, and over successive night shifts, are difficult to reconcile with published data on accident risk. In light of this, we have examined two large sets of alertness ratings with a view to further refining the model and identifying additional factors that may influence alertness at any given point in time. Our results indicate that, at least for the range of sleep durations and wake-up times commonly found on rotating shift systems, we may assume the phase of the endogenous circadian component of alertness (process C) to be "set" by the time of waking. Such an assumption considerably enhanced the predictive power of the model and yielded remarkably similar phase estimates to those obtained by maximizing the post-hoc fit of the model. We then examined the manner in which obtained ratings differed from predicted values over a complete 8-day cycle of two, 12-h shift systems. This revealed a pronounced "first night compensation effect" that resulted in shift workers rating themselves as progressively more alert than would be predicted over the course of the first night shift. However, this appeared to be achieved only at the cost of lowered ratings on the second night shift. Finally, we were able to identify a "time on shift" effect whereby, with the exception of the first night shift, alertness ratings decreased over the course of each shift before showing a modest "end effect." We conclude that the identification of these additional components offers the possibility that in the future we may be able to predict trends in accident risk on abnormal sleep-wake schedules.},

abstract = {The diffusion model is a commonly used tool to infer latent psychological processes underlying decision-making, and to link them to neural mechanisms based on response times. Although efficient open source software has been made available to quantitatively fit the model to data, current estimation methods require an abundance of response time measurements to recover meaningful parameters, and only provide point estimates of each parameter. In contrast, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation methods are useful for enhancing statistical power, allowing for simultaneous estimation of individual subject parameters and the group distribution that they are drawn from, while also providing measures of uncertainty in these parameters in the posterior distribution. Here, we present a novel Python-based toolbox called HDDM (hierarchical drift diffusion model), which allows fast and flexible estimation of the the drift-diffusion model and the related linear ballistic accumulator model. HDDM requires fewer data per subject/condition than non-hierarchical methods, allows for full Bayesian data analysis, and can handle outliers in the data. Finally, HDDM supports the estimation of how trial-by-trial measurements (e.g., fMRI) influence decision-making parameters. This paper will first describe the theoretical background of the drift diffusion model and Bayesian inference. We then illustrate usage of the toolbox on a real-world data set from our lab. Finally, parameter recovery studies show that HDDM beats alternative fitting methods like the $\chi$(2)-quantile method as well as maximum likelihood estimation.

We found that the simultaneous activation of multiple goals restricted the set of acceptable means to ones that benefitted (or at least, did not harm) the entire set of active goals. Two moderators of this phenomenon were identified: (a) the feasibility of identifying multifinal means, which was dependent on the relations between the different active goals, and (b) the enhanced importance of the focal goal, which resulted in the inhibition of its alternatives and the consequent relaxation of multifinality constraints.},

abstract = {Bayesian hypothesis testing presents an attrac-tive alternative to p value hypothesis testing. Part I of this series outlined several advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing, including the ability to quantify evidence and the ability to monitor and update this evidence as data come in, without the need to know the intention with which the data were collected. Despite these and other practical advantages, Bayesian hypothesis tests are still reported rel-atively rarely. An important impediment to the widespread adoption of Bayesian tests is arguably the lack of user-friendly software for the run-of-the-mill statistical problems that confront psychologists for the analysis of almost every experiment: the t-test, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and contingency tables. In Part II of this series we introduce JASP (www.jasp-stats.org), an open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly graphical software package that allows users to carry out Bayesian hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems. JASP is based in part on the Bayesian analyses},

The measurement of response time (RT), the amount of time it takes to make a decision, offers a cost-effective and direct way to study the choice process. Yet, relatively little theory exists to guide the integration of RT into economic analysis. This article presents a canonical process model from psychology and neuroscience, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM), and shows that many RT phenomena in the economics literature are consistent with the predictions of the DDM. Additionally, use of the class of sequential sampling models facilitates a more principled consideration of findings from cognitive science and neuroeconomics. An application of the DDM to a binary choice dataset demonstrates the rich inference made possible when using models that can jointly model choice and process, highlighting the need for more work in this area.},

The model reveals how stimulus information guides decisions and shows how the information is processed through time to yield sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect decisions. Rapid two-choice decisions yield multiple empir- ical measures: response times for correct and error responses, the probabilities of correct and error responses, and a variety of interac- tions between accuracy and response time that depend on instructions and task difficulty. The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do. Variability within the decision process explains how errors are made, and variability across trials correctly predicts when errors are faster than correct responses and when they are slower.},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using a worked example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading, and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction, and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

@article{Libedinsky2013,
abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sleep deprivation would affect the discounting of delayed rewards, of rewards entailing the expense of effort, or both. DESIGN: We measured rates of two types of reward discounting under conditions of rested wakefulness (RW) and sleep deprivation (SD). Delay discounting was defined as the willingness to accept smaller monetary rewards sooner rather than larger monetary rewards later. Effort discounting was defined as the willingness to accept smaller rewards that require less effort to obtain (e.g., typing a small number of letter strings backward) over larger but more effortful rewards (e.g., typing more letter strings to receive the reward). The first two experiments used a crossover design in which one session was conducted after a normal night of sleep (RW), and the other after a night without sleep (SD). The first experiment evaluated only temporal discounting whereas the second evaluated temporal and effort discounting. In the second experiment, the discounting tasks were repeatedly administered prior to the state comparisons to minimize the effects of order and/or repeated testing. In a third experiment, participants were studied only once in a between-subject evaluation of discounting across states. SETTING: The study took place in a research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-seven healthy young adult participants: 20 in Experiment 1, 27 in Experiment 2, and 30 in Experiment 3. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep deprivation elicited increased effort discounting but did not affect delay discounting. CONCLUSIONS: The dissociable effects of sleep deprivation on two forms of discounting behavior suggest that they may have differing underlying neural mechanisms.},

However, when people were asked to compete directly with a strong performer, their own performance declined.

In the present paper, we replicate and extend this work. In studies with experienced bank managers, Chinese graduate students, and advanced-level MBA students, we find overwhelming support for the importance of project completion on investment intentions, with no indication of typical sunk cost effects. We argue that our results support a goal substitution explanation for many escalation phenomena where, as progress moves forward on a project, completion of the project itself takes increasing precedence over other goals (e. g., economic profit) that may have been more salient at the time the project was initiated.},

Our study examines the factors that affect intended and unintended termination and the longevity of IJVs. The findings show that approximately 90 percent of all IJV terminations are unintended and 10 percent intended, and that the frequency of intended termination and unintended termination varies noticeably depending on the initial purposes of formation. This suggests that the termination of IJVs is significantly contingent on their formation. The findings also show that the longevity of IJVs varies according to the initial purposes of formation, the initial conditions under which the IJV is formed, and the types of unanticipated contingencies that it encounters. The key theoretical issues and practical implications of the distinction between the intended and unintended termination of IJVs are also discussed.},

abstract = {Bayesian data analysis involves describing data by meaningful mathematical models, and allocating credibility to parameter values that are consistent with the data and with prior knowledge. The Bayesian approach is ideally suited for constructing hierarchical models, which are useful for data structures with multiple levels, such as data from individuals who are members of groups which in turn are in higher-level organizations. Hierarchical models have parameters that meaningfully describe the data at their multiple levels and connect information within and across levels. Bayesian methods are very flexible and straightforward for estimating parameters of complex hierarchical models (and simpler models too). We provide an introduction to the ideas of hierarchical models and to the Bayesian estimation of their parameters, illustrated with two extended examples. One example considers baseball batting averages of individual players grouped by fielding position. A second example uses a hierarchical extension of a cognitive process model to examine individual differences in attention allocation of people who have eating disorders. We conclude by discussing Bayesian model comparison as a case of hierarchical modeling.},

abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often un-fruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established – and thus those tasks become popular – when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low re-liability for individual differences, destroying replicable corre-lations with other factors and potentially undermining pub-lished conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychol-ogy, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects – low between-participant variability – makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qual-itatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimen-tal psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chem-istry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

An alternative point of view, which has gained momentum in recent years, focuses on deviance and dissent as normal and healthy aspects of group life. In this review, we focus on the motivations that group members have to deviate and dissent, and the functional as well as the dysfunctional effects of deviance and dissent. In doing so we aim for a balanced and complete account of deviance and dissent, highlighting when such behaviors will be encouraged as well as when they will be punished.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite growing recognition of the importance of multidimensional assessments of craving, little is known about how both approach and avoidance of alcohol inclinations change during the course of treatment, or relate to treatment outcomes. The current study examined the relationship between approach inclinations, avoidance inclinations, and treatment outcomes in individuals seeking treatment for alcohol dependence, and investigated whether changes in approach and avoidance ratings were associated with changes in drinking.

METHODS: Individuals (n=81) seeking treatment for alcohol dependence were randomized to receive either 12-sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy plus healthy living skills or 12-sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy plus affect regulation training. Participants provided pre- and post- treatment scores on various measures including drinking behaviors and approach and avoidance inclinations to use alcohol.

RESULTS: Results indicated that both approach and avoidance inclinations were uniquely and significantly associated with problem recognition, and that avoidance inclinations were uniquely related to taking steps to make a change in alcohol use at baseline. In addition, avoidance inclinations were positively associated with number of sessions attended with no association found for approach ratings. Finally, results suggested that changes observed in drinking outcomes (drinks/day and{\%} days abstinent) were significantly associated with changes in approach, but not avoidance inclinations.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of measuring both desire to consume and desire to avoid consuming alcohol simultaneously and suggest that avoidance inclinations are associated with treatment initiation and retention, and approach inclinations with positive treatment outcomes.},

abstract = {Multilevel theory and research have advanced organizational science but are limited because the research focus is incomplete. Most quantitative research examines top-down, contextual, cross-level relationships. Emergent phenomena that manifest from the bottom up from the psychological characteristics, processes, and interactions among individuals—although examined qualitatively—have been largely neglected in quantitative research. Emergence is theoretically assumed, examined indirectly, and treated as an inference regarding the construct validity of higher level measures. As a result, quantitative researchers are investigating only one fundamental process of multilevel theory and organizational systems. This article advances more direct, dynamic, and temporally sensitive quantitative research methods designed to unpack emergence as a process. We argue that direct quantitative approaches, largely represented by computational modeling or agent-based simulation, have much to offer with respect to illuminating the mechanisms of emergence as a dynamic process. We illustrate how indirect and direct approaches can be complementary and, appropriately integrated, have the potential to substantially advance theory and research. We conclude with a set of recommendations for advancing multilevel research on emergent phenomena in teams and organizations.},

abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology's lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

In this article, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing an agent-based debiasing framework for developing investment DSS. Identifying the primary characteristics of major biases influencing investment decisions through a thorough literature review, we propose a taxonomy to categorise them as cognitive, affective or conative. Cognitive biases are information-processing biases. Affective biases involve general moods and emotions. Conative biases are relatively stable personality traits such as overconfidence and inertia. We then outline debiasing strategies for each of these bias categories and identify decision-support characteristics necessary in software agents to carry out the appropriate debiasing tasks. An agent-based DSS architecture is then proposed, and a detailed trading example triggering a sample bias detection and debiasing algorithm is discussed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor and Francis.},

The participants were classified as users of one of three strategies: Weighted Additive Utility (WADD), Equal Weight rule and Take-The-Best heuristic (TTB). Fifty-nine percent of the participants were classified as users of the compensatory WADD strategy and 29{\%} as users of the non-compensatory TTB. Moreover, the WADD users achieved higher task accuracy without showing time costs. The results provide support for the existence of an automatic compensatory mecha-nism in weighted average estimations.},

abstract = {In light of the Office of the Secretary Defense's Roadmap for unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), there is a critical need for research examining human interaction with heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. The OSD Roadmap clearly delineates the need to investigate the “appropriate conditions and requirements under which a single pilot would be allowed to control multiple airborne UA (unmanned aircraft) simultaneously.” Toward this end, in this paper, we provide a meta-analysis of research studies across unmanned aerial and ground vehicle domains that investigated single operator control of multiple vehicles. As a result, a hierarchical control model for single operator control of multiple unmanned vehicles (UV) is proposed that demonstrates those requirements that will need to be met for operator cognitive support of multiple UV control, with an emphasis on the introduction of higher levels of autonomy. The challenge in achieving effective management of multiple UV systems in the future is not only to determine whether automation can be used to improve human and system performance, but how and to what degree across hierarchical control loops, as well as determining the types of decision support that will be needed by operators given the high-workload environment. We address when and how increasing levels of automation should be incorporated in multiple UV systems and discuss the impact on not only human performance, but more importantly, on system performance.},

abstract = {Can recent failures to replicate psychological research be explained by typical magnitudes of statistical power, bias or heterogeneity? A large survey of 12,065 estimated effect sizes from 200 meta-analyses and nearly 8,000 papers is used to assess these key dimensions of replicability. First, our survey finds that psychological research is, on average, afflicted with low statistical power. The median of median power across these 200 areas of research is about 36{\%}, and only about 8{\%} of studies have adequate power (using Cohen's 80{\%} convention). Second, the median proportion of the observed variation among reported effect sizes attributed to heterogeneity is 74{\%} (I 2). Heterogeneity of this magnitude makes it unlikely that the typical psychological study can be closely replicated when replication is defined as study-level null hypothesis significance testing. Third, the good news is that we find only a small amount of average residual reporting bias, allaying some of the often expressed concerns about the reach of publication bias and questionable research practices. Nonetheless, the low power and high heterogeneity that our survey finds fully explain recent difficulties to replicate highly-regarded psychological studies and reveal challenges for scientific progress in psychology.},

abstract = {Many decisions involve multiple stages of choices and events, and these decisions can be represented graphically as decision trees. Optimal decision strategies for decision trees are commonly determined by a backward induction analysis that demands adherence to three fundamental consistency principles: dynamic, consequential, and strategic. Previous research found that decision-makers tend to exhibit violations of dynamic and strategic consistency at rates significantly higher than choice inconsistency across various levels of potential reward. The current research extends these findings under new conditions; specifically, it explores the extent to which these principles are violated as a function of the planning horizon length of the decision tree. Results from two experiments suggest that dynamic inconsistency increases as tree length increases; these results are explained within a dynamic approach-avoidance framework.

Aviat Space Environ Med 2004; 75(3, Suppl.):A4 –A14. Background: Biomathematical models that quantify the effects of circadian and sleep/wake processes on the regulation of alertness and performance have been developed in an effort to predict the magnitude and timing of fatigue-related responses in a variety of contexts (e.g., transmeridian travel, sustained operations, shift work). This paper sum-marizes key features of seven biomathematical models reviewed as part of the Fatigue Methods: An invitation was sent to de-velopers of seven biomathematical models that were commonly cited in scientific literature and/or supported by government funding. On accep-tance of the invitation to attend the Workshop, developers were asked to complete a survey of the goals, capabilities, inputs, and outputs of their biomathematical models of alertness and performance. Data from the completed surveys were summarized and juxtaposed to provide a framework for comparing features of the seven models. Results: Survey responses revealed that models varied greatly relative to their reported goals and capabilities. While all modelers reported that circadian factors were key components of their capabilities, they differed markedly with regard to the roles of sleep and work times as input factors for prediction: four of the seven models had work time as their sole input variable(s), while the other three models relied on various aspects of sleep timing for model input. Models also differed relative to outputs: five sought to predict results from laboratory experiments, field, and operational data, while two models were developed without regard to predicting labora-tory experimental results. All modelers provided published papers de-scribing their models, with three of the models being proprietary. Con-clusions: Although all models appear to have been fundamentally influenced by the two-process model of sleep regulation by Borb{\'{e}}ly (6), there is considerable diversity among them in the number and type of input and output variables, and their stated goals and capabilities.},

abstract = {The history of human performance modeling is rooted in a practical need to support engineering design, and it is a longer history than one might suspect. Of course, there also have been many models of behavior proposed and tested in the psy-chological literature throughout the history of ex-perimental psychology. This article is not about those models but rather is a survey of models of in-tegrated human task performance – models that can be represented mathematically or programmed in a computer and can, in principle, produce pre-dictions of human performance of practical im-portance. These models are integrated in the sense that they encompass the entire information-processing system from sensory input to motor output and, unlike more standard psychological models, are not limited to representing percep-tion, memory, or decision making in isolation. The history of these types of models dates from at least World War II. As early as the 1940s, well more than the 50 years this article series is cele-brating, engineers were interested in the design of artifacts such as military power-assisted gun turret controls used to track moving targets. These sys-tems came into being with the growth of the nascent field of servomechanisms. The guts of a servomechanism of the kind that controlled a gun turret typically included a pow-erful electric motor or a hydraulic pump that could develop high torque at low speeds to move the tur-ret around and could be controlled by a low-power electrical signal derived from a control device that could be operated by a human controller. They were almost always embedded in a feedback loop, which improved their stability. Although many have been interested in the temporal response – the relationship between sensed input and motor out-put as a function of time – engineers discovered that the properties of such devices are best char-acterized by understanding the temporal response after it has been transformed into frequency re-sponse terms, that is, the ratio of output to input amplitude and the lag in response over the range of frequencies to which they are sensitive. For systems that respond linearly to these inputs, the entire frequency response function can be char-acterized by a mathematical expression called the transfer function.},

abstract = {A single coherent framework is proposed to synthesize long-standing research on 8 seemingly unrelated cognitive decision-making biases. During the past 6 decades, hundreds of empirical studies have resulted in a variety of rules of thumb that specify how humans systematically deviate from what is normatively expected from their decisions. Several complementary generative mechanisms have been proposed to explain those cognitive biases. Here it is suggested that (at least) 8 of these empirically detected decision-making biases can be produced by simply assuming noisy deviations in the memory-based information processes that convert objective evidence (observations) into subjective estimates (decisions). An integrative framework is presented to show how similar noise-based mechanisms can lead to conservatism, the Bayesian likelihood bias, illusory correlations, biased self-other placement, subadditivity, exaggerated expectation, the confidence bias, and the hard-easy effect. Analytical tools from information theory are used to explore the nature and limitations that characterize such information processes for binary and multiary decision-making exercises. The ensuing synthesis offers formal mathematical definitions of the biases and their underlying generative mechanism, which permits a consolidated analysis of how they are related. This synthesis contributes to the larger goal of creating a coherent picture that explains the relations among the myriad of seemingly unrelated biases and their potential psychological generative mechanisms. Limitations and research questions are discussed.},

abstract = {Higher-level cognition depends on the ability to learn models of the world.We can characterize this at the computational level as a structure-learning problem with the goal of best identifying the prevailing causal relationships among a set of relata. However, the computational cost of performing exact Bayesian inference over causal models grows rapidly as the number of relata increases. This implies that the cognitive processes underlying causal learning must be substantially approximate. A powerful class of approximations that focuses on the sequential absorption of successive inputs is captured by the Neurath's ship metaphor in philosophy of science, where theory change is cast as a stochastic and gradual process shaped as much by people's limited willingness to abandon their current theory when considering alternatives as by the ground truth they hope to approach. Inspired by this metaphor and by algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference in machine learning, we propose an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning under which learners represent only a single global hypothesis that they update locally as they gather evidence. We propose a related scheme for understanding how, under these limitations, learners choose informative interventions that manipulate the causal system to help elucidate its workings. We find support for our approach in the analysis of four experiments.},

The emergence of affordable, but non-representative online samples has reinvigorated debates about the external validity of experiments. We conduct two studies of how experimental treatment effects obtained from convenience samples compare to effects produced by population samples. In Study 1, we compare effect estimates from four different types of convenience samples and a population-based sample. In Study 2, we analyze treatment effects obtained from 20 experiments implemented on a population-based sample and Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The results reveal considerable similarity between many treatment effects obtained from convenience and nationally representative population-based samples. While the results thus bolster confidence in the utility of convenience samples, we conclude with guidance for the use of a multitude of samples for advancing scientific knowledge.},

abstract = {A recent study of the replicability of key psychological findings is a major contribution toward understanding the human side of the scientific process. Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36{\%} of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77{\%} of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95{\%} prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers' intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

abstract = {The RISK of an event generally relates to its expected severity and the perceived probability of its occurrence. In RISK research, however, there is no standard measure for subjective probability estimates. In this study, we compared five commonly used measurement formats--two rating scales, a visual analog scale, and two numeric measures--in terms of their ability to assess subjective probability judgments when objective probabilities are available. We varied the probabilities (low vs. moderate) and severity (low vs. high) of the events to be judged as well as the presentation mode of objective probabilities (sequential presentation of singular events vs. graphical presentation of aggregated information). We employed two complementary goodness-of-fit criteria: the correlation between objective and subjective probabilities (sensitivity), and the root mean square deviations of subjective probabilities from objective values (accuracy). The numeric formats generally outperformed all other measures. The severity of events had no effect on the performance. Generally, a rise in probability led to decreases in performance. This effect, however, depended on how the objective probabilities were encoded: pictographs ensured perfect information, which improved goodness of fit for all formats and diminished this negative effect on the performance. Differences in performance between scales are thus caused only in part by characteristics of the scales themselves-they also depend on the process of encoding. Consequently, researchers should take the source of probability information into account before selecting a measure.},

abstract = {Objectives: The study examined two moderating variables that may influence the direction of the effect of self-efficacy upon performance, namely; time spent on task and task complexity. Design: Multilevel analysis was conducted to examine within person and between group relationships. Method: Eighty eight novice golfers putted in 4 sessions over a period of 2 days (completing 800 putts in total). Each session contained 10 trials of 20 putts. The golfers were split into 2 conditions; a stable task condition where task requirements remained constant across time and a dynamic task condition, where task complexity changed across time. Results: In early learning (i.e., the first 10 trials) results revealed a slight negative effect between self-efficacy and subsequent performance. However, across the 40 trials self-efficacy had a positive effect upon subsequent performance. Further, there was a significant task condition (stable vs. dynamic) interaction. In the easy task condition, self-efficacy showed a slight (but non-significant) positive effect upon performance. However, in the dynamic learning condition, self-efficacy had a positive and significant effect upon subsequent performance. Conclusion: Previous tests of the within person self-efficacy relationship tend to limit learning to 10 trials or less. The study is the first to examine the reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy and performance as a result of task experience (i.e., time spent on the task) and task complexity simultaneously. Positive effects emerged as a result of extended time learning the task and by varying the degree of task complexity whilst learning. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Associationism accounts for the phenomena of both conditioning and "higher" forms of learning via concepts such as excitation, inhibition, and reinforcement, whereas cognitive theories assume that learning depends on hypothesis testing, cognitive models, and propositional reasoning. Cognitive theories have received considerable impetus in regard to both human and animal learning from recent research suggesting that the key illustration of cue selection in learning, blocking, often arises from inferential reasoning. At the same time, a dichotomous view that separates noncognitive, unconscious (implicit) learning from cognitive, conscious (explicit) learning has gained favor. This review selectively describes key findings from this research, evaluates evidence for and against associative and cognitive explanatory constructs, and critically examines both the dichotomous view of learning as well as the claim that learning can occur unconsciously.},

abstract = {Working with artificial agents is a challenging endeavor, often imposing high levels of workload on human operators who work within these socio-technical systems. We seek to understand these workload demands through examining the literature in major content areas of human-robot interaction. As research on HRI continues to explore a host of issues with operator workload, there is a need to synthesize the extant literature to determine its current state and to guide future research. Within HRI socio-technical systems, we reviewed the empirical literature on operator information processing and action execution. Using multiple resource theory (MRT; Wickens, 2002) as a guiding framework, we organized this review by the operator perceptual and responding demands which are routinely manipulated in HRI studies. We also reviewed the utility of different interventions for reducing the strain on the perceptual system (e.g., multimodal displays) and responses (e.g., automation). Our synthesis of the literature demonstrates that much is known about how to decrease operator workload, but there are specific gaps in knowledge due to study operations and methodology. This work furthers our understanding of workload in complex environments such as those found when working with robots. Principles and propositions are provided for those interested in decreasing operator workload in applied settings and also for future research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The quality or precision of stimulus representations in visual working memory can be characterized by a power law, which states that precision decreases as a power of the number of items in memory, with an exponent whose magnitude typically varies in the range 0.5 to 0.75. The authors show that the magnitude of the exponent is an index of the attentional demands of memory formation. They report 5 visual working memory experiments with tasks using noisy, backward-masked stimuli that varied in their attentional demands and show that the magnitude of the exponent increases systematically with the attentional demands of the task. Recall accuracy in the experiments was well described by an attention-weighted sample-size model that views visual working memory as a resource comprised of noisy evidence samples that are recruited during stimulus exposure and which can be allocated flexibly under attentional control. The magnitude of the exponent indexes the degree to which attention allocates resources to items in memory unequally rather than equally. The amount of information we can extract from a single brief glance and store in memory is very limited, contrary to what our phenomenal experience of the world suggests. Many estimates have put the limit on this form of memory, known as visual working memory or visual short-term memory (STM), at around four items (Cowan, 2001; Luck {\&} Vogel, 1997; Shibuya {\&} Bundesen, 1988). Visual working memory plays a central role in supporting the decision processes that translate perception into action and its capacity limits are of theoretical importance to researchers investigating the cognitive and neural basis of purpo-sive behavior. Recent memory research has focused on whether the number of items that can be stored in memory is fixed or variable and on how memory representations change in quality as a func-tion of the number of stored items},

I examine three primary themes. First, I speculate as to why it is that research treatments of team processes are largely static and what may account for this inertia. Second, I consider the conceptual underpinnings of process dynamics with respect to (a) emergence across levels and (b) in terms of variability, trajectory, and cyclical fluctuation. Third, I discuss three ways that research on team process dynamics can be advanced by: (a) adapting existing research methods, (b) creating innovative measurement techniques, and (c) advancing new research paradigms. Empirical examination of team dynamics is on the research frontier. These suggestions hold promise for advancing understanding of dynamic process mechanisms.},

These findings are consistent with two theories of the influence of concept learning on similarity. By a Strategic Judgment Bias account, the categories associated with objects are explicitly used as cues for determining similarity, and objects that are categorized together are judged to be more similar because similarity is not only a function of the objects themselves, but also the objects' category labels. By a Changed Object Description account, category learning alters the description of the objects themselves, emphasizing properties that are relevant for categorization. A new method for distinguishing between these accounts is introduced which measures the difference between the similarity ratings of categorized objects to a neutral object. The results indicate both strategic biases based on category labels and genuine representational change, with the strategic bias affecting mostly objects belonging to different categories and the representational change affecting mostly objects belonging to the same category.

abstract = {Abstract Interruptions and distractions are a feature of work in most complex sociotechnical systems in which people must handle multiple threads of work. Over the last 10-15 years there has been a crescendo of reviews and investigations into the impact that interruptions and distractions have on safety-critical aspects of healthcare work, such as medication administration, but findings are still inconclusive. Despite this, many healthcare communities have taken steps to reduce interruptions and distractions in safety-critical work tasks, a step that will usually do no harm but that may have unintended consequences. Investigations with a higher yield of certainty would provide better evidence and better guidance to healthcare communities. In this viewpoint paper we survey some key papers reporting investigations of interruptions and distractions in the field, in simulators, and in the laboratory. We also survey reports of field interventions aimed at minimizing interruptions and distractions with the intention of improving the safety of medication administration and other safety-critical healthcare tasks. To analyse the papers adopting each form of investigation, we use the three dimensions of fidelity, formal control exercised, and the potential generalizability to the field. We argue that studies of interruptions and distractions outside the healthcare clinical context, but intended to generalize to it, should become more formally representative of the cognitive context of healthcare work. Research would be improved if investigators undertook programs of studies that successively achieve fidelity, control, and potential generalizability, or if they strengthened the design of individual studies.},

abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term “generative” is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both “inductive” and “deductive” science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling pro- vides a powerful way to address certain enduring—and especially interdisciplinary—questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories—such as neoclassical microeconomics—to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise—or “map up”—to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based (“bottom up”) models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theo- retical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent- based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science—some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since “emer- gence” figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible.},

Findings from both cross-cultural research and laboratory experiments support the alternative view that ingroup identification is independent of negative attitudes toward outgoups and that much ingroup bias and intergroup discrimination is motivated by preferential treatment of ingroup members rather than direct hostility toward outgroup members. Thus to understand the roots of prejudice and discrimination requires first of all a better understanding of the functions that ingroup formation and identification serve for human beings. This article reviews research and theory on the motivations for maintenance of ingroup boundaries and the implications of ingroup boundary protection for intergroup relations, conflict, and conflict prevention.},

abstract = {Although previous research suggests that regulatory focus matters for organizational citizenship behaviors, it is unclear how promotion and prevention focus relate to such behaviors. Integrating regulatory focus theory with theories of self-regulation, we propose a conceptual model that links trait promotion and prevention foci with specific citizenship behaviors through an emotion-related self-regulation mechanism. Using a sample of 227 nurses working in a hospital context, we observed that trait promotion focus and trait prevention focus predict helping and voice via differential effects on emotional exhaustion. Specifically, trait promotion focus had unconditional indirect effects on helping (positive) and voice (negative) through lower levels of emotional exhaustion. In contrast, trait prevention focus was positively related to voice but negatively related to helping through higher levels of emotional exhaustion. Moreover, these indirect effects of trait prevention focus were moderated by employees' reappraisal of their emotional experiences at work, such that trait prevention focus had weaker relations with helping and voice when reappraisal was higher (vs. lower). We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings and highlight avenues for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {Behavioral decision research compares theoretical constructs like preferences to behavior such as observed choices. Three fairly common links from constructs to behavior are (1) to tally, across participants and decision problems, the number of choices consistent with one predicted pattern of pairwise preferences; (2) to compare what most people choose in each decision problem against a predicted preference pattern; or (3) to enumerate the decision problems in which two experimental conditions generate a 1-sided significant difference in choice frequency 'consistent' with the theory. Although simple, these theoretical links are heuristics. They are subject to well-known reasoning fallacies, most notably the fallacy of sweeping gener-alization and the fallacy of composition. No amount of replication can alleviate these fallacies. On the contrary, reiterating logically inconsistent theoretical reasoning over and again across studies obfuscates science. As a case in point, we consider pairwise choices among simple lotteries and the hypotheses of overweighting or underweighting of small probabilities, as well as the description– experience gap. We discuss ways to avoid reasoning fallacies in bridging the conceptual gap between hypothetical constructs, such as, for example, " overweighting " to observable pairwise choice data. Although replication is invaluable, successful replication of hard-to-interpret results is not. Behavioral decision research stands to gain much theoretical and empirical clarity by spelling out precise and formally explicit theories of how hypothetical constructs translate into observable behavior.},

abstract = {Modeling human decision making behavior is of great interest in understanding how a decision maker weights different decision attributes when making a decision. Such knowledge is critically important in helping predict future decisions, evaluating human decision performance, and improving the design of human and machine interface systems. Decision field theory (DFT) provides a psychological representation of the cognitive deliberation process, which is driven by the fluctuations of a person's attention among decision attributes. In this research area, the most common use of a DFT model is to estimate or predict the human decisions by using a set of pre-specified expected attention weights (EAWs) in the DFT model. Unlike other research, this paper extends the capabilities of DFT in a complementary direction, showing how to fit or train a DFT model by estimating the EAW based on sequentially obtained samples of decision trials. Furthermore, the inherent connection between the EAW and the decision choice uncertainty is investigated. The proposed modeling method is discussed in detail for a two-alternative decision scenario based on two attributes. Both simulations and a case study are conducted in the paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Our understanding of cognition has been advanced by two traditionally non-overlapping and non-interacting groups. Mathematical psychologists rely on behavioral data to evaluate formal models of cognition, whereas cognitive neuroscientists rely on statistical models to understand patterns of neural activity, often without any attempt to make a connection to the mechanism supporting the computation. Both approaches suffer from critical limitations as a direct result of their focus on data at one level of analysis (cf. Marr, 1982), and these limitations have inspired researchers to attempt to combine both neural and behavioral measures in a cross-level integrative fashion. The importance of solving this problem has spawned several entirely new theoreti-cal and statistical frameworks developed by both mathematical psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. However, with each new approach comes a par-ticular set of limitations and benefits. In this article, we survey and charac-terize several approaches for linking brain and behavioral data. We organize these approaches on the basis of particular cognitive modeling goals: (1) us-ing the neural data to constrain a behavioral model, (2) using the behavioral model to predict neural data, and (3) fitting both neural and behavioral data simultaneously. Within each goal, we highlight a few particularly success- ful approaches for accomplishing that goal, and discuss some applications. Finally, we provide a conceptual guide to choosing among various analytic approaches in performing model-based cognitive neuroscience.},

In the present article we survey research situated at this interface, considering work from cognitive and social psychology and behavioral economics, but with a particular focus on neuro-science research. We organize existing findings into three core areas, consid-ering them in the light of currently vying theoretical perspectives. Based on the accumulated evidence, we advocate for a view of control function that treats it as a domain of reward-based decision making. More broadly, we argue that neuroscientific evidence plays a critical role in understanding the mechanisms by which motivation and cognitive control interact.

Results showed that only for those who were inclined to seek distance from the majority, minority group identification increased when discrimination was high compared with low. Discussion focuses on the way that seeking distance might be an important strategy for coping with discrimination.},

Enhanced processing fluency leading to more favorable evaluations in conditions of compatibility appears to underlie these effects.

abstract = {Speeding is one of the main factors of car crash-risk, but it also contributes to increasing air-pollution. In two studies we attempted to lead drivers to abide by speed limits using "reducing air-pollution" as a new argument. We presented prevention messages that highlighted the role of speeding in increasing "crash-risk", "air-pollution", or both (Studies 1 and 2). The messages were also positively or negatively framed (Study 2). Given that women are more concerned with environmental issues than are men, we expected the following hypotheses to be validated for women. The message with the "air-pollution" argument was expected to be evaluated more positively than the "crash-risk" message (H1). The "air-pollution" and "crash-risk and air-pollution" messages were expected to be more effective than the "crash-risk" message on the behavioral intention to observe speed limits (H2a) and on the perceived efficacy of speed-limit observance in reducing air-pollution (H2b; Studies 1 and 2). Furthermore, positive framing was expected to be more effective than negative framing (H3), and presenting a message to be more effective than presenting no message (H4; Study 2). Broadly, our results argue in favor of our hypotheses. However in Study 2, the effects of message framing did not allow us to conclude that negative or positive framing was superior. All in all, messages with the "air-pollution" argument were more effective at leading drivers to observe speed limits. Thus, environmental protection may be a fruitful route to explore for increasing road safety.},

abstract = {It has been argued that hyperbolic discounting of future gains and losses leads to time-inconsistent behavior and thereby, in the context of health economics, not enough investment in health and too much indulgence of unhealthy consumption. Here, we challenge this view. We set up a life-cycle model of human aging and longevity in which individuals discount the future hyperbolically and make time-consistent decisions. This allows us to disentangle the role of discounting from the time consistency issue. We show that hyperbolically discounting individuals, under a reasonable normalization, invest more in their health than they would if they had a constant rate of time preference. Using a calibrated life-cycle model of human aging, we predict that the average U.S. American lives about 4 years longer with hyperbolic discounting than he would if he had applied a constant discount rate. The reason is that, under hyperbolic discounting, experiences in old age receive a relatively high weight in life time utility. In an extension we show that the introduction of health-dependent survival probability motivates an increasing discount rate for the elderly and, in the aggregate, a u-shaped pattern of the discount rate with respect to age.},

abstract = {A quantitative description of the human information processor is required for predicting operator workload and performance from the simulated task time line data generated by task network models and related methods. Although many models of workload exist, few appear to be well founded in theory or to provide a satisfactory basis for a quantitative representation of operator load. Adherents of both time- and intensity-based models of operator load individually claim success for their methods, which might suggest that both factors are operating in determining operator workload and performance. This paper describes a study that explicitly investigates the relationship between a time-based factor and an intensity-based factor (amount of information to be processed) within a simulated air traffic control environment. A model is developed that posits that the load on the human information-processing system results directly from the ratio of the time necessary to process the required information to the time allowable for making a decision. This ratio, which can be identified with time pressure, determines subjective estimates of workload as well as operator performance. The model is tested against the data from the air traffic control simulation.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Although many theories of causal cognition are based on causal graphical models, a key property of such models—the independence relations stipulated by the Markov condition—is routinely violated by human reasoners. This article presents three new accounts of those independence violations, accounts that share the assumption that people's understanding of the correlational structure of data generated from a causal graph differs from that stipulated by causal graphical model framework. To distinguish these models, experiments assessed how people reason with causal graphs that are larger than those tested in previous studies. A traditional common cause network (← → Y X Y 1 2) was extended so that the effects themselves had effects (← ← → → Z Y X Y Z 1 1 2 2). A traditional common effect network (→ ← Y X Y 1 2) was extended so that the causes themselves had causes (→ → ← ← Z Y X Y Z 1 1 2 2). Subjects' inferences were most consistent with the beta-Q model in which consistent states of the world—those in which variables are either mostly all present or mostly all absent—are viewed as more probable than stipulated by the causal graphical model framework. Substantial variability in subjects' inferences was also observed, with the result that substantial minorities of subjects were best fit by one of the other models (the dual prototype or a leaky gate models). The discrepancy between normative and human causal cognition stipulated by these models is foundational in the sense that they locate the error not in people's causal reasoning but rather in their causal representations. As a result, they are applicable to any cognitive theory grounded in causal graphical models, including theories of analogy, learning, explanation, categorization, decision-making, and counterfactual reasoning. Preliminary evidence that independence violations indeed generalize to other judgment types is presented.},

abstract = {Research on person categorization suggests that people automatically and inflexibly categorize others according to group memberships, such as race. Consistent with this view, research using electroencephalography (EEG) has found that White participants tend to show an early difference in processing Black versus White faces. Yet, new research has shown that these ostensibly automatic biases may not be as inevitable as once thought and that motivational influences may be able to eliminate these biases. It is unclear, however, whether motivational influences shape the initial biases or whether these biases can only be modulated by later, controlled processes. Using EEG to examine the time course of biased processing, we manipulated approach and avoidance motivational states by having participants pull or push a joystick, respectively, while viewing White or Black faces. Consistent with previous work on own-race bias, we observed a greater P100 response to White than Black faces; however, this racial bias was attenuated in the approach condition. These data suggest that rapid social perception may be flexible and can be modulated by motivational states.},

abstract = {• We investigate how hierarchical models improve point estimates of subject-level parameters. • One accuracy measure used is the correlation between the model parameter and the subject's trait variable. • Another accuracy measure used is the root mean square error from the true parameter. • For both measures, the conditions under which the hierarchical model is superior to other non-hierarchical methods are clarified. a b s t r a c t Computational models have been used to analyze the data from behavioral experiments. One objective of the use of computational models is to estimate model parameters or internal variables for individual subjects from behavioral data. The estimates are often correlated with other variables that characterize subjects in order to investigate which computational processes are associated with specific personal or physiological traits. Although the accuracy of the estimates is important for these purposes, the parameter estimates obtained from individual subject data are often unreliable. To solve this problem, researchers have begun to use hierarchical modeling approaches to estimate parameters of computational models from multiple-subject data. It is widely accepted that the hierarchical model provides reliable estimates compared to other non-hierarchical approaches. However, how and under what conditions the hierarchical models provide better estimates than other approaches has yet to be systematically investigated. This study attempts to investigate these issues, focusing on two measures of estimation accuracy: the correlation between estimates of individual parameters and subject trait variables and the absolute measures of error (root mean squared error, RMSE) of the estimates. An analytical calculation based on a simple Gaussian model clarifies how the hierarchical model improves the point estimates of these two measures. We also performed simulation studies employing several realistic computational models based on the synthesized data to confirm that the theoretical properties hold in realistic situations.},

abstract = {We asked participants to make simple risky choices while we recorded their eye movements. We built a complete statistical model of the eye movements and found very little systematic variation in eye movements over the time course of a choice or across the different choices. The only exceptions were finding more (of the same) eye movements when choice options were similar, and an emerging gaze bias in which people looked more at the gamble they ultimately chose. These findings are inconsistent with prospect theory, the priority heuristic, or decision field theory. However, the eye movements made during a choice have a large relationship with the final choice, and this is mostly independent from the contribution of the actual attribute values in the choice options. That is, eye movements tell us not just about the processing of attribute values but also are independently associated with choice. The pattern is simple—people choose the gamble they look at more often, independently of the actual numbers they see—and this pattern is simpler than predicted by decision field theory, decision by sampling, and the parallel constraint satisfaction model.

abstract = {Regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997) has received growing attention in organizational psychology, necessitating a quantitative review that synthesizes its effects on important criteria. In addition, there is need for theoretical integration of regulatory focus theory with personality research. Theoretical integration is particularly relevant, since personality traits and dispositions are distal factors that are unlikely to have direct effects on work behaviors, yet they may have indirect effects via regulatory focus. The current meta-analysis introduces an integrative framework in which the effects of personality on work behaviors are best understood when considered in conjunction with more proximal motivational processes such as regulatory focus. Using a distal-proximal approach, we identify personality antecedents and work-related consequences of regulatory foci in a framework that considers both general and work-specific regulatory foci as proximal motivational processes. We present meta-analytic results for relations of regulatory focus with its antecedents (approach and avoid temperaments, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness, self-esteem, and self-efficacy) and its consequences (work behaviors and attitudes). In addition to estimates of bivariate relationships, we support a meta-analytic path model in which distal personality traits relate to work behaviors via the mediating effects of general and work-specific regulatory focus. Results from tests of incremental and relative validity indicated that regulatory foci predict unique variance in work behaviors after controlling for established personality, motivation, and attitudinal predictors. Consistent with regulatory focus theory and our integrative theoretical framework, regulatory focus has meaningful relations with work outcomes and is not redundant with other individual difference variables.},

abstract = {Decision-making invokes two fundamental axes of control: affect or valence, spanning reward and punishment, and effect or action, spanning invigoration and inhibition. We studied the acquisition of instrumental responding in healthy human volunteers in a task in which we orthogonalized action requirements and outcome valence. Subjects were much more successful in learning active choices in rewarded conditions, and passive choices in punished conditions. Using computational reinforcement-learning models, we teased apart contributions from putatively instrumental and Pavlovian components in the generation of the observed asymmetry during learning. Moreover, using model-based fMRI, we showed that BOLD signals in striatum and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) correlated with instrumentally learnt action values, but with opposite signs for go and no-go choices. Finally, we showed that successful instrumental learning depends on engagement of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Our behavioral and computational data showed that instrumental learning is contingent on overcoming inherent and plastic Pavlovian biases, while our neuronal data showed this learning is linked to unique patterns of brain activity in regions implicated in action and inhibition respectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Stimuli in letter-discrimination and brightness-discrimination tasks were degraded with static and dynamic noise. The onset and the time course of decision making were quantified by fitting the data with the diffusion model. Dynamic noise and, to a lesser extent, static noise, produced large shifts in the leading edge of the response-time distribution in letter discrimination but had little effect in brightness discrimination. The authors interpret these shifts as changes in the onset of decision making. The different pattern of shifts in letter discrimination and brightness discrimination implies that decision making in the 2 tasks was affected differently by noise. The changes in response-time distributions found with letter stimuli are inconsistent with the hypothesis that noise increases response times to letter stimuli simply by reducing the rate at which evidence accumulates in the decision process. Instead, they imply that noise also delays the time at which evidence accumulation begins. The delay is shown not to be the result of strategic processes or the result of using different stimuli in different tasks. The results imply, rather, that the onset of evidence accumulation in the decision process is time-locked to the perceptual encoding of the stimulus features needed to do the task. Two mechanisms that could produce this time-locking are described.},

Our model captures the slower recovery process after chronic sleep restriction. Our model describes the beneficial effects of banking sleep on performance. a b s t r a c t Performance prediction models based on the classical two-process model of sleep regulation are reasonably effective at predicting alertness and neurocognitive performance during total sleep deprivation (TSD). However, during sleep restriction (partial sleep loss) performance predictions based on such models have been found to be less accurate. Because most modern operational environments are predominantly characterized by chronic sleep restriction (CSR) rather than by episodic TSD, the practical utility of this class of models has been limited. To better quantify performance during both CSR and TSD, we developed a unified mathematical model that incorporates extant sleep debt as a function of a known sleep/wake history, with recent history exerting greater influence. This incorporation of sleep/wake history into the classical two-process model captures an individual's capacity to recover during sleep as a function of sleep debt and naturally bridges the continuum from CSR to TSD by reducing to the classical two-process model in the case of TSD. We validated the proposed unified model using psychomotor vigilance task data from three prior studies involving TSD, CSR, and sleep extension. We compared and contrasted the fits, within-study predictions, and across-study predictions from the unified model against predictions generated by two previously published models, and found that the unified model more accurately represented multiple experimental studies and consistently predicted sleep restriction scenarios better than the existing models. In addition, we found that the model parameters obtained by fitting TSD data could be used to predict performance in other sleep restriction scenarios for the same study populations, and vice versa. Furthermore, this model better accounted for the relatively slow recovery process that is known to characterize CSR, as well as the enhanced performance that has been shown to result from sleep banking.

With this development to ever-deeper architectures it raises the question why the brain has not developed such architecture. Besides wiring constraints we argue that the brain operates under different circumstances when performing object recognition, being confronted with noisy and ambiguous sensory input. The role of time in the process of object recognition is investigated, showing that a recurrent neural network is able to integrate evidence about an object's identity over time. When trained with reinforcement learning the agent is able to learn the amount of time needed to come to an accurate estimate of the stimulus. The behavior and activity of the network are similar to findings from human and animal studies of perceptual decision-making.},

abstract = {Summw. Two processes play a dominant role in sleep regu-lation: a sleep-dependent process (Process S) and a sleep-in-dependent circadian process (Process C). The timecourse of Process S was derived from the spectral analysis of slow wave activity in the human EEG. Its level shows an exponential decline during sleep and an increase during waking. The level of Process S at sleep onset is therefore a function of prior wa-king time. Process C is reflected by the rhythmic variation of sleep propeusity during prolonged sleep deprivation, and is assumed to be controlled by a circadian oscillator. In the model, sleep propensity and the duration of sleep are deter-mined by the combined action of the two processes. The mo-del is able to simulate the variations of sleep duration as a function of sleep onset time. Since the amount of REM sleep is little influenced by prior sleep or waking and shows a mark-ed circadian rhythmicity, it is assumed to reflect largely the level of Process C. The cyclic alternation of nonREM and REM sleep is assumed to result from a reciprocal interaction between the two sleep states. In contrast to previous models, only a single circadian oscillator is required to account for the sleep-wake cycle and the sleep organization under en-trained and non-entrained schedules. The model also encom-passes sleep regulation in animals and may provide indica-tions as to the phylogenetic origin of sleep. In this article a model of sleep regulation is presented which is based on experimental studies. The first two sections are devoted to a review of the relevant literature. The model it-self and some of its implications are described and discussed in sections III and IV.},

It is shown under what circumstances it is attractive to use Bayesian estimation, and how to interpret properly the results. First, the ingredients underlying Bayesian methods are introduced using a simplified example. Thereafter, the advantages and pitfalls of the specification of prior knowledge are discussed. To illustrate Bayesian methods explained in this study, in a second example a series of studies that examine the theoretical framework of dynamic interactionism are considered. In the Discussion the advantages and disadvantages of using Bayesian statistics are reviewed, and guidelines on how to report on Bayesian statistics are provided.},

abstract = {Work motivation is a topic of crucial importance to the success of organizations and societies and the well-being of individuals. We organize the work motivation literature over the last century using a meta-framework that clusters theories, findings, and advances in the field according to their primary focus on (a) motives, traits, and motivation orientations (content); (b) features of the job, work role, and broader environment (context); or (c) the mechanisms and processes involved in choice and striving (process). Our integrative review reveals major achievements in the field, including more precise mapping of the psychological inputs and operations involved in motivation and broadened conceptions of the work environment. Cross-cutting trends over the last century include the primacy of goals, the importance of goal striving processes, and a more nuanced conceptualization of work motivation as a dynamic, goal-directed, resource allocation process that unfolds over the related variables of time, experience, and place. Across the field, advances in methodology and measurement have improved the match between theory and research. Ten promising directions for future research are described and field experiments are suggested as a useful means of bridging the research–practice gap. Motivation related to work remains one of the most enduring and compelling topics in industrial/organizational (I/O) psychol-ogy. As part of the larger field of motivational science, motivation related to work examines fundamental questions about the influ-ence of nonability person attributes (e.g., motives, traits, goals), work ecologies, and the mechanisms and processes involved in purposive action. Work motivation affects the skills that individ-uals develop, the jobs and careers that individuals pursue, and the manner in which individuals allocate their resources (e.g., atten-tion, effort, time, and human and social capital) to affect the direction, intensity, and persistence of activities during work. At the same time, work motivation is a topic of critical importance to public policymakers and organizations concerned with developing work environments, human resource policies, and management practices that promote vocational adjustment, individual well-being, and organizational success. As such, work motivation stands at the nexus of society, science, and organizational success. The increasing importance of motivation over the last century is reflected in both the number and nature of motivation-related publications that have appeared in Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP). As shown in Figure 1, the number of these publications (as indexed by keyword count) has increased over the decades. How-ever, a more thorough perusal of these articles indicates that motivation (although always considered important) did not truly emerge as a major research topic in JAP until the mid-20th century, with the introduction of theories by Atkinson (1958), Bandura (1977), Carver and Scheier (1981), Deci (1975), Fishbein and Ajzen (1975), Hackman and Oldham (1975), Locke (1966), Vroom (1964), and others. As these research streams have ma-tured, motivation-related publications in JAP have focused on the role of individual differences (e.g., traits and motives), resource allocation and self-regulation processes, and the sociostructural context of work. As JAP celebrates its centennial, theory and research on work motivation stands at an important crossroad. Recent changes in the nature of work and the workforce have increased the need for new knowledge that can be used to cultivate and sustain work motivation. These trends, along with the avail-ability and increasing use of new methodologies to track work experiences, assess motives, and evaluate motivational processing across levels and over time suggest that the field is well-positioned (and overdue) for yet another round of innovation and growth. With these developments in mind, the purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to provide a meta-framework for organizing and understanding the work motivation literature as it has evolved over the last century, (2) to highlight major contributions and themes in different parts of the meta-framework (with an emphasis on works published in JAP), and (3) to identify major trends and promising future research directions. Motivation is frequently used as an umbrella term meant to capture the dense network of concepts and their interrelations that underlie observable changes in the initiation, direction, intensity, and persistence of voluntary action. As in other complex areas of human functioning, researchers have pursued different aspects of the phenomena in ways that have sometimes led to confusion in understanding, studying, and managing work motivation. We pro-pose a heuristic meta-framework (see Figure 2) that expands the often used process-content organization of relevant theories and motivation-related concepts into a tripartite organization: content, context, and process (Kanfer, Chen, {\&} Pritchard, 2008). We base this organization on the observation that motivation theory and research in JAP and related journals has been driven by three fundamental questions: (1) What desires, wants, and needs elicit action? This is the classic question of what features of the indi-vidual spurs action, and pertains to the role of needs, universal motives (e.g., mastery, autonomy), and trait-based preferences. (2) What role do environmental factors play in motivation? Most theories of motivation recognize that behavior is also influenced by its context. Recently, Johns (2006) has suggested a multilevel perspective in which discrete contextual variables, such as job-related characteristics, sociostructural variables, physical condi-tions, and work events are nested within broader omnibus contex-tual variables, such as occupation, culture, and economic conditions. Most theory-driven research in JAP has focused on proximal or discrete contextual variables. (3) Through what psy-chological processes and mechanisms do person and environment factors affect the direction, intensity, and persistence of action? Process-oriented research focuses on the " how " of motivation. That is, what are the cognitive and affective mechanisms and processes by which individuals integrate person and environmental inputs to form goals, plans, and intentions (goal choice), and regulate their affect, attention, effort, and behavior for the purpose of goal accomplishment (goal striving). Several process-oriented theories currently popular in work motivation provide an integra-tive conceptualization of the processes involved in goal choice and goal striving. Our organization of the field and major contributions follows from our systems approach, rather than adopting a strict historical perspective. As shown in Figure 2, within each section, theories, constructs, and research findings are clustered in terms of concep-tual communalities and differentiated in terms of when we noted each approach to appear most prominently in the work motivation literature (often years after a theory's introduction in the broader psychology literature). In the content segment, we highlight theo-ries and empirical findings on motives presumed fundamental for 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Mo va on Self-regula on},

Participants read vignettes describing hypothetical experiments, along with the result of the initial observation, considered as either a possibility (foresight) or a reality (hindsight). Experiment 1 found that the initial observation seemed more likely to be replicated when viewed in hindsight than in foresight. The remaining experiments contrasted responses to an initial observation from 1 of the 4 studies that was either expected or unexpected (based on the predictions of participants in Experiment 1). Experiments 2A-C and Experiment 3 found that unexpected results were more likely to be attributed to methodological problems than were expected ones-but to the same degree in foresight and in hindsight. Participants in Experiment 4 had more confidence in an explanation for an unexpected outcome when it was mentioned before that outcome was revealed than when it was suggested only after the surprise was known. In all the experiments, most participants recommended collecting more data before publishing the results, especially when they attributed the results to multiple causes. The results suggest that considering the causes of unexpected experimental results in foresight may improve the evaluation and communication of those results in hindsight.},

The data on which this conclusion is based stem chiefly from the study of eyeblink conditioning in Man as a function of personality, and from the study of the physiological locus of action of the extraverting drug, sodium amobarbital, in animals. It is suggested that the physiological basis of introversion includes, besides the Ascending Reticular Activating System, an inhibitory system comprising the orbital frontal cortex, the medial septal area and the hippocampus. This system is able to carry out the essential psychological functions believed by Eysenck to underlie introversion-extraversion. A new conception of neuroticism as reflecting degree of sensitivity to both reward and punishment is also proposed. ?? 1970.},

@article{Myerson1995,
abstract = {The present paper addresses the question of the form of the mathematical relation between the time until a delayed reward and its present value. Data are presented from an experiment in which subjects chose between hypothetical amounts of money available either immediately or after a delay (Green, Fry, {\&} Myerson, 1994). Analyses of the behavior of individual young adults demonstrated that temporal discounting is better described by hyperbola-like functions than by exponential decay functions. For most individuals, the parameter that determines the rate of discounting varied inversely with amount. Raising the denominator of the discounting function to a power resulted in better descriptions of the data from most subjects. Two possible derivations of the temporal discounting function are proposed, a repeated choice model and an expected value model. These provide theoretical interpretations for amount-dependent discounting but amount-independent exponent parameters. Humans and other animals typically will choose more immediate rewards over delayed rewards of equal magnitude. What is surprising , at least from certain perspectives, is that often they also will choose more immediate rewards over delayed rewards of larger magnitude. Many different accounts of the latter finding have been offered (e.g., lack of impulse control, poor ego strength, conflict between multiple selves), but the dominant account in the behavioral economic literature relies on the assumption that the value of a future reward decreases with increasing length of time to its receipt (Kagel, Battalio, {\&} Green, 1995). This decrease in value as a function of delay is termed temporal discounting. The temporal discounting account posits that a smaller, more immediate reward may be chosen because the present (or subjective) value of the larger, more delayed reward is discounted; hence, its present value may be less than that of the more immediate reward. From the perspective of temporal discounting , the question of interest becomes the nature of the mathematical relation among amount, delay, and value. Economists and psychologists have typically employed two different approaches to determining this func},

abstract = {Many phenomena in judgment and decision making are often attributed to the interaction of 2 systems of reasoning. Although these so-called dual process theories can explain many types of behavior, they are rarely formalized as mathematical or computational models. Rather, dual process models are typically verbal theories, which are difficult to conclusively evaluate or test. In the cases in which formal (i.e., mathematical) dual process models have been proposed, they have not been quantitatively fit to experimental data and are often silent when it comes to the timing of the 2 systems. In the current article, we present a dynamic dual process model framework of risky decision making that provides an account of the timing and interaction of the 2 systems and can explain both choice and response-time data. We outline several predictions of the model, including how changes in the timing of the 2 systems as well as time pressure can influence behavior. The framework also allows us to explore different assumptions about how preferences are constructed by the 2 systems as well as the dynamic interaction of the 2 systems. In particular, we examine 3 different possible functional forms of the 2 systems and 2 possible ways the systems can interact (simultaneously or serially). We compare these dual process models with 2 single process models using risky decision making data from Guo, Trueblood, and Diederich (2017). Using this data, we find that 1 of the dual process models significantly outperforms the other models in accounting for both choices and response times.},

abstract = {Most theoretical and empirical research on intertemporal choice assumes a deterministic and static perspective, leading to the widely adopted delay discounting models. As a form of preferential choice, however, intertemporal choice may be generated by a stochastic process that requires some deliberation time to reach a decision. We conducted 3 experiments to investigate how choice and decision time varied as a function of manipulations designed to examine the delay duration effect, the common difference effect, and the magnitude effect in intertemporal choice. The results, especially those associated with the delay duration effect, challenged the traditional deterministic and static view and called for alternative approaches. Consequently, various static or dynamic stochastic choice models were explored and fit to the choice data, including alternative-wise models derived from the traditional exponential or hyperbolic discount function and attribute-wise models built upon comparisons of direct or relative differences in money and delay. Furthermore, for the first time, dynamic diffusion models, such as those based on decision field theory, were also fit to the choice and response time data simultaneously. The results revealed that the attribute-wise diffusion model with direct differences, power transformations of objective value and time, and varied diffusion parameter performed the best and could account for all 3 intertemporal effects. In addition, the empirical relationship between choice proportions and response times was consistent with the prediction of diffusion models and thus favored a stochastic choice process for intertemporal choice that requires some deliberation time to make a decision.},

abstract = {The majority of the literature on the psychology of gains and losses suggests that losses lead to an avoidance response. Several studies, however, have shown that losses can also lead to an approach response, whereby an option is selected more often when it produces losses. In five studies we examine the boundary conditions for these contradictory approach and avoidance effects. The results show that an approach response emerges only when losses are produced by a highly advantageous choice alternative and when participants have ample unbiased direct or vicarious experience with this alternative. Addi- tionally, the avoidance response to losses is also not ubiquitous and emerges when alternatives producing losses are experienced as disadvantageous. Thus, the findings suggest that both the approach and avoidance effects of losses exist and can be accounted for by increased investment of cognitive resources with losses (i.e., loss attention). Additionally, the findings clarify the loss attention account in indicating that losses increase exploitative behavior based on experienced outcomes, a process which can be locally optimal.

abstract = {It is well established that emotion plays a key role in human social and economic decision making. The recent literature on emotion regulation (ER), however, highlights that humans typically make efforts to control emotion experiences. This leaves open the possibility that decision effects previously attributed to acute emotion may be a consequence of acute ER strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. In Study 1, we manipulated ER of laboratory-induced fear and disgust, and found that the cognitive reappraisal of these negative emotions promotes risky decisions (reduces risk aversion) in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and is associated with increased performance in the prehunch/hunch period of the Iowa Gambling Task. In Study 2, we found that naturally occurring negative emotions also increase risk aversion in Balloon Analogue Risk Task, but the incidental use of cognitive reappraisal of emotions impedes this effect. We offer evidence that the increased effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal in reducing the experience of emotions underlies its beneficial effects on decision making.},

Previous comparisons have not considered Rmax tasks, and differences identified between the models' predictions have centered on practice effects. Unlike the parameter-free optimal performance curves of the pure DDM, the extended DDM and LBA predict families of curves depending on their additional parameters, and those of the LBA show significant differences from the DDMs, especially for poorly discriminable stimuli that incur high error rates. Moreover, fits to behavior reveal that the LBA and DDM provide different interpretations of behavior as stimulus discriminability increases. Trends for threshold setting (caution) in the DDMs are consistent between fits, while in the corresponding LBA fits, thresholds interact with distributions of starting points in a complex manner that depends upon parameter constraints. Our results suggest that reinterpretation of LBA parameters may be necessary in modeling the Rmax paradigm.},

@article{Barsalou1999,
abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

abstract = {Most workplace phenomena take place in dynamic social settings and emerge over time, and scholars have re-peatedly called for more research into the temporal dynamics of organizational behavior. One reason for this persistent re-search gap could be that organizational scholars are not aware of the methodological advances that are available today for modeling temporal interactions and detecting behavioral pat-terns that emerge over time. To facilitate such awareness, this Methods Corner contribution provides a hands-on tutorial for capturing and quantifying temporal behavioral patterns and for leveraging rich interaction data in organizational settings. We provide an overview of different approaches and method-ologies for examining temporal interaction patterns, along with detailed information about the type of data that needs to be gathered in order to apply each method as well as the analytical steps (and available software options) involved in each method. Specifically, we discuss and illustrate lag se-quential analysis, pattern analysis, statistical discourse analy-sis, and visualization methods for identifying temporal pat-terns in interaction data. We also provide key takeaways for integrating these methods more firmly in the field of organi-zational research and for moving interaction analytical re-search forward. This is the tenth paper in the Methods Corner series of the Journal of Business and Psychology. Previous works in this series have focused on a range of methodological issues and applications in business and managerial psychology, includ-ing tests of mediation (MacKinnon, Coxe, {\&} Baraldi, 2012), the implementation of structural equation modeling for meta-analysis (Landis, 2013), the use of moderator models and analysis (Dawson, 2014), the analysis of historical data in organizational research (Zickar, 2015), the use of latent vari-able confirmatory factor analysis for addressing common method variance (Williams {\&} McGonagle, 2016), and most recently, the precision and utility of mixed-effects models (Bliese, Maltarich, {\&} Hendricks, 2017). The current paper adds a new perspective to the series by highlighting different ways to study and model temporal interaction dynamics in organizational settings. Organizational scholars increasingly appreciate the value of focusing on behavior and modeling temporal behavioral contingencies, as indicated by several conceptual and theoret-ical works in the team process as well as the leadership liter Yet, empirical efforts at addressing the calls that are put forth in these conceptual papers remain sparse. One reason could be that organizational scholars are not aware of the methodolog-ical advances that are available today for modeling social dy-namics in behavioral interactions. To address this gap, this Methods Corner paper highlights social interaction analysis as a rich temporal behavioral approach for studying workplace phenomena such as team process dynamics and leader-follower interactions.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined operators' capacity to successfully reallocate highly autonomous in-flight missiles to time-sensitive targets while performing secondary tasks of varying complexity. BACKGROUND: Regardless of the level of autonomy for unmanned systems, humans will be necessarily involved in the mission planning, higher level operation, and contingency interventions, otherwise known as human supervisory control. As a result, more research is needed that addresses the impact of dynamic decision support systems that support rapid planning and replanning in time-pressured scenarios, particularly on operator workload. METHOD: A dual screen simulation that allows a single operator the ability to monitor and control 8, 12, or 16 missiles through high level replanning was tested on 42 U.S. Navy personnel. RESULTS: The most significant finding was that when attempting to control 16 missiles, participants' performance on three separate objective performance metrics and their situation awareness were significantly degraded. CONCLUSION: These results mirror studies of air traffic control that demonstrate a similar decline in performance for controllers managing 17 aircraft as compared with those managing only 10 to 11 aircraft. Moreover, the results suggest that a 70{\%} utilization (percentage busy time) score is a valid threshold for predicting significant performance decay and could be a generalizable metric that can aid in manning predictions. APPLICATION: This research is relevant to human supervisory control of networked military and commercial unmanned vehicles in the air, on the ground, and on and under the water.},

Using experience-sampling methodology with a sample of hospital residents, it is shown that negative emotion and fatigue following disruptive events are intensified when only limited energy resources are available due to current workload. However, positive emotions, promoted by goal-enhancing events, are mitigated due to inability to capitalize on new opportunities or challenges. Aftereffects of work events reveal that the energizing effect of goal-enhancing events mitigates end-of-day fatigue and negative emotion on high-workload days, although the effect of disruptive events is diminished by the end of such days, apparently because of lesser conspicuity against a background of high workload.

During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species.

First, an air traffic control simulation was used to examine the interaction between effort intensity and scores on the Anxiety subscale of Eysenck Personality Profiler Neuroticism in the prediction of task performance. Overall effort intensity enhanced performance for highly anxious individuals more so than for individuals with low anxiety. Second, a longitudinal field study was used to examine the interaction between office busyness and Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism in the prediction of telesales performance. Changes in office busyness were associated with greater performance improvements for highly neurotic individuals compared with less neurotic individuals. These studies suggest that highly neurotic individuals outperform their stable counterparts in a busy work environment or if they are expending a high level of effort.},

Drawing on social influence and behavioral intention theories, this study hypothesized that perceived supervisory influence, coworker risk taking, and parental risk taking serve as key exogenous variables of risk-taking orientation at work. Risk-taking orientation was further hypothesized to serve as a direct predictor and full mediator of work injury. The effect of parental risk taking was also hypothesized to be mediated through global risk taking, which in turn was posited to predict risk-taking orientation at work. Longitudinal results from 2,542 adolescents working across a wide spectrum of jobs supported hypothesized linkages, although there was some evidence of partially mediated mechanisms. Coworker risk taking was a relatively strong predictor of youths' risk-taking orientation at work.},

abstract = {Self-regulation at work is conceived in terms of within-person processes that occur over time. These processes are proposed to occur within a hierarchical framework of negative feedback systems that operate at different levels of abstraction and with different time cycles. Negative feedback systems respond to discrepancies in a manner that reduces deviations from standards (i.e., goals). This is in contrast to positive feedback systems in which discrepancies are created, which can lead to instability. We organize our discussion around four hierarchical levels-self, achievement task, lower-level task action, and knowledge/working memory. We theorize that these levels are loosely connected by multiple constraints and that both automatic and more conscious processes are essential to self-regulation. Within- and cross-level affective and cognitive processes interact within this system to motivate goal-related behaviors while also accessing needed knowledge and protecting current intentions from interference. Complications common in the work setting (as well as other complex, real-life settings) such as the simultaneous pursuit of multiple goals, the importance of knowledge access and expertise, and team and multiperson processes are also discussed. Finally, we highlight the usefulness of newer research methodologies and data-analytic techniques for examining such hierarchical, dynamic, within-person processes.},

We show how a smartphone app that we have developed, ENTRAIN, accurately collects data on sleep habits around the world. Through mathematical modeling and statistics, we find that social pressures weaken and/or conceal biological drives in the evening, leading in-dividuals to delay their bedtime and shorten their sleep. A country's average bedtime, but not average wake time, predicts sleep duration. We further show that mathematical models based on controlled laboratory experi-ments predict qualitative trends in sunrise, sunset, and light level; however, these effects are attenuated in the real world around bedtime. Additionally, we find that women schedule more sleep than men and that users reporting that they are typically exposed to outdoor light go to sleep earlier and sleep more than those reporting indoor light. Finally, we find that age is the primary determinant of sleep timing, and that age plays an important role in the variability of population-level sleep habits. This work better defines and personalizes " normal " sleep, produces hypotheses for future testing in the laboratory, and suggests important ways to counteract the global sleep crisis.},

abstract = {The present study with college students examined the effect of amount on the discounting of probabilistic monetary rewards. A hyperboloid function accurately described the discounting of hypothetical rewards ranging in amount from {\$}20 to {\$}10,000,000. The degree of discounting increased continuously with amount of probabilistic reward. This effect of amount was not due to changes in the rate parameter of the discounting function, but rather was due to increases in the exponent. These results stand in contrast to those observed with the discounting of delayed monetary rewards, in which the degree of discounting decreases with reward amount due to amount-dependent decreases in the rate parameter. Taken together, this pattern of results suggests that delay and probability discounting reflect different underlying mechanisms. That is, the fact that the exponent in the delay discounting function is independent of amount is consistent with a psychophysical scaling interpretation, whereas the finding that the exponent of the probability-discounting function is amount-dependent is inconsistent with such an interpretation. Instead, the present results are consistent with the idea that the probability-discounting function is itself the product of a value function and a weighting function. This idea was first suggested by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), although their prospect theory does not predict amount effects like those observed. The effect of amount on probability discounting was parsimoniously incorporated into our hyperboloid discounting function by assuming that the exponent was proportional to the amount raised to a power. The amount-dependent exponent of the probability-discounting function may be viewed as reflecting the effect of amount on the weighting of the probability with which the reward will be received.},

abstract = {Evidence accumulation models of decision-making have led to advances in several different areas of psychol-ogy. These models provide a way to integrate response time and accuracy data, and to describe performance in terms of latent cognitive processes. Testing important psycholog-ical hypotheses using cognitive models requires a method to make inferences about different versions of the mod-els which assume different parameters to cause observed effects. The task of model-based inference using noisy data is difficult, and has proven especially problematic with current model selection methods based on parame-ter estimation. We provide a method for computing Bayes factors through Monte-Carlo integration for the linear bal-listic accumulator (LBA; Brown {\&} Heathcote, 2008), a widely used evidence accumulation model. Bayes factors are used frequently for inference with simpler statistical models, and they do not require parameter estimation. In order to overcome the computational burden of estimating Bayes factors via brute force integration, we exploit general purpose graphical processing units; we provide free code for this. This approach allows estimation of Bayes factors via Monte-Carlo integration within a practical time frame. We demonstrate the method using both simulated and real data. We investigate the stability of the Monte-Carlo approx-imation, and the LBA's inferential properties, in simulation studies.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we provide a tutorial review of the class of sequential sampling models of two-choice decision-making. These models, which have been developed in cognitive and mathematical psychology over the last 50 years, pro-vide a detailed quantitative account of performance in simple, speeded choice tasks. The models explain the major findings from a wide variety of behavioral decision tasks, including the relationship between choice probabilities and response time (RT), the speed-accuracy tradeoff, the shapes of RT distributions, and the relative speed of correct and error responses. More recently, electrophysiological recordings from decision-related brain areas in awake behaving monkeys have revealed a correspondence between patterns of neural firing and the statistical processes of evidence accumulation assumed in the psychological models. We discuss the the-oretical relationship between the cognitive process of evidence accumulation and neural firing rates and show how neural data can constrain behavioral models. Importantly, constraints from neurophysiological data can be used to test between models that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. The convergence of psychological theory and neurophysiological data suggests that a common theoretical and math-ematical framework is sufficient to account for simple decision-making data at neural and behavioral levels of analysis. The simplest decision an organism can make involves choosing between two alternatives. The importance of such two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) deci-sions is reflected in the extent to which they have been studied in psychology and, {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016 M. Reuter and C. Montag (eds.), Neuroeconomics, Studies in Neuroscience, Psychology and Behavioral Economics, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-35923-1{\_}14 253 more recently, in behavioral economics. For both psychologists and economists, the fundamental theoretical questions involve what is chosen, as a function of the discriminability or desirability of the alternatives, how long it takes to make the choice, and what mechanisms determine the choice. A wealth of 2AFC data col-lected over the last 50 years has led to detailed analyses of the relationship between psychology's two ubiquitous dependent variables: choice probability and response time (RT). Probably the most familiar expression of this relationship is in the speed-accuracy tradeoff, which describes people's ability to trade speed against accuracy in decision-making tasks (e.g., Luce 1986; Wickelgren 1977). In psychology, the theoretical understanding of the choice-RT relationship has been guided by the development of the influential class of sequential sampling models. According to these models, decisions are made by summing, or accumulating, samples of noisy evidence over time. Statistical variability in the moment-to-moment quality of the evidence is assumed to reflect noise in the cognitive or neural processes that code for different response alternatives. A response is initiated only after sufficient evi-dence for a decision is obtained. Successful sequential sampling models, such as Ratcliff's (1978), Ratcliff and McKoon (2008) diffusion model, account for behavioral data at the level of choice probabilities and the shapes of correct and error RT distributions. The model's ability to provide very detailed accounts of data suggests that decision-making in simple decision tasks does indeed occur via a process of accumulating evidence to a criterion. The characterization of decision-making as a process of accumulating evidence over time has attracted the attention of neuroscientists studying the neural correlates of decision-making. Using analogs of 2AFC decision tasks, in which monkeys respond to visually presented stimuli by making saccadic eye movements, neuro-scientists have uncovered striking similarities between the firing rates of neurons in lateral intraparietal area (LIP), superior colliculus (SC), and the frontal eye fields (FEF) on the one hand, and the dynamics of evidence accumulation postulated by sequential sampling models on the other. Neurons in these brain areas are part of the oculomotor control circuit that is active when making saccadic eye movements. This invites the theoretical linking proposition (Schall 2004; Teller 1984) that activity in this circuit provides an online reflection of the accumulating evidence state prior to executing an eye movement. Indeed, patterns of neuronal firing rate data in regions involved in perceptual decision-making appear to reflect the temporal integration, or accumulation, of evidence over relatively long time scales (e.g., Shadlen and Newsome 1996; for a review see Gold and Shadlen 2007). The correspondence between psychological theory and neurophysiological data suggests that phenomena at both cognitive and neural levels of analysis may be understood in terms of a common theoretical and mathematical framework (Smith and Ratcliff 2004). The principal benefit of such correspondence is that insights at one level of analysis impose constraints on the other. The development of sequential sampling models from psychology has guided neurophysiological empirical investigations (e.g., Ratcliff et al. 2003, 2007), and neurophysiological data have proved diagnostic in testing between models that are otherwise difficult to distinguish on the basis of behavioral data alone (e.g., Purcell et al. 2010; Ratcliff et al. 2011).},

abstract = {Based on optimal foraging theory, we propose a metric that allows evaluating the goodness of goal systems, that is, systems comprising multiple goals with facilitative and conflicting interrelations. This optimal foraging theory takes into account expectancy and value, as well as opportunity costs, of foraging. Applying this approach to goal systems provides a single index of goodness of a goal system for goal striving. Three quasi-experimental studies (N ϭ 277, N ϭ 145, and N ϭ 210) provide evidence for the usefulness of this approach for goal systems comprising between 3 to 10 goals. Results indicate that persons with a more optimized goal-system are more conscientious and open to new experience, are more likely to represent their goals in terms of means (i.e., adopt a process focus), and are more satisfied and engaged with their goals. Persons with a suboptimal goal system tend to switch their goals more often and thereby optimize their goal system. We discuss limitations as well as possible future directions of this approach.},

abstract = {The ultimate test of the validity of a cognitive theory is its ability to predict patterns of empirical data. Cognitive models formalize this test by making specific processing assumptions that yield mathematical predictions, and the mathematics allow the models to be fitted to data. As the field of cognitive science has grown to address increasingly complex problems, so too has the complexity of models increased. Some models have become so complex that the mathematics detailing their predictions are intractable, meaning that the model can only be simulated. Recently, new Bayesian techniques have made it possible to fit these simulation-based models to data. These techniques have even allowed simulation-based models to transition into neuroscience, where tests of cognitive theories can be biologically substantiated. The Increasing Granularity of Cognitive Science As the quality of everyday computational resources has improved, so too has our ability as scientists to pursue more nuanced explanations of the mind. In some lines of work, our pursuit has lead to the development of neurally plausible architectures of the brain [1-4], while in others it has led to advanced modeling of individual-or even trial-level decision dynamics [5-7]. Central to both of these endeavors is the development of computational models whose mechanisms mimic our conceptualization of the mind. Because our understanding of the mind is still in its infancy, there are many theoretical mechanisms that remain plausible representations of the computations performed by the mind, and cognitive scientists are working to provide evidence for specific mechanisms. To test the plausibility of a mechanism, we must determine whether it can produce patterns of data that might be observed when studying real-world behavior (e.g., an experiment). Like knobs on a machine, parameters control the mechanisms within a computational model, where different settings of the parameters produce different predictions for data. The range of predictions a model can make is then limited by the range of values the parameters can take. Hence, testing the validity of our computational model is determined by whether the knobs can be adjusted in such a way to produce data that closely match what we observe in the real world. Mechanisms provide the bridge that connects the data that we observe in the real world with our theoretical explanation of how those data came to be. In statistics, this bridge is embodied in the likelihood function (see Glossary) because it quantifies how likely the data are under the model. Although mechanisms with likelihood functions have served cognitive scientists well in recent years, in part by facilitating our understanding of individual differences through hierarchical Bayesian analyses [5,8-10], the mechanisms supporting neurally plausible computations are typically more complex. They are so complex that their likelihood functions are unusable: either the functions are too poorly behaved to be computed efficiently or they have no analytic form and cannot be computed at all. As a consequence, until now it has been computationally Highlights Likelihood functions quantify the likelihood of a specific pattern of data given a particular cognitive model. However, as cognitive models become more complex, their likelihood functions become increasingly difficult to calculate. Cognitive models are becoming so complex that their likelihood functions cannot be directly calculated. Therefore , new tools to approximate the likelihood functions of these complex models are needed. Likelihood-free techniques, such as approximate Bayesian computation, allow scientists to simulate datasets that can be compared to observed datasets so as to estimate a likelihood function for the model. Likelihood-free techniques permit researchers to use neurally plausible architectures to understand individual differences in cognitive performance.},

abstract = {In accounting for phenomena present in preferential choice experiments, modern models assume a wide array of different mechanisms such as lateral inhibition, leakage, loss aversion, and saliency. These mechanisms create interesting predictions for the dynamics of the deliberation process as well as the aggregate behavior of preferential choice in a variety of contexts. However, the models that embody these different mechanisms are rarely subjected to rigorous quantitative tests of suitability by way of model fitting and evaluation. Recently, complex, stochastic models have been cast aside in favor of simpler approximations, which may or may not capture the data as well. In this article, we use a recently developed method to fit the four extant models of context effects to data from two experiments: one involving consumer goods stimuli, and another involving perceptual stimuli. Our third study investigates the relative merits of the mechanisms currently assumed by the extant models of context effects by testing every possible configuration of mechanism within one overarching model. Across all tasks, our results emphasize the importance of several mechanisms such as lateral inhibition, loss aversion, and pairwise attribute differences, as these mechanisms contribute positively to model performance. Together, our results highlight the notion that mathematical tractability, while certainly a convenient feature of any model, should neither be the primary impetus for model development nor the promoting or demotion of specific model mechanisms. Instead, model fit, balanced with model complexity, should be the greatest burden to bear for any theoretical account of empirical phenomena.},

abstract = {Although alliance studies have generally favored an ambidextrous approach between exploration and exploitation, they tend to overlook a firm's characteristics, its industry constraints, or the dynamic network in which the firm is embedded. This study examines the ambidexterity hypothesis and its boundary conditions with a unique research method. We not only analyze empirical data from five U.S. industries spanning eight years, but also expand theoretical insights to the network level by building a computer simulation model. Both our empirical and simulation results reveal the contingencies of the ambidexterity hypothesis in alliance formation. Our findings show that although an ambidextrous formation of alliances benefits large firms, a focused formation of either exploratory or exploitative alliances benefits small firms. In an uncertain environment an ambidextrous formation enhances firm performance but so does a focused formation in a stable environment. Finally, the simulation model demonstrates that a firm's centrality and structural hole positions in network relations can moderate the relationships between alliance formation choices and firm performance, and that the ambidexterity hypothesis may be limited to the earlier stage of the network. Our study provides critical evidence into the viability of adopting a dynamic network perspective in understanding the ambidexterity hypothesis and advancing strategic alliance research beyond static and dyadic levels.},

Outcomes that are easy or impossible to attain or avoid require little or no energization and will be relatively low in attractiveness, if positive, or low in unpleasantness, if negative. This formulation was supported by four experiments that demonstrated (a) attractiveness of a goal is a non-monotonic function of perceived difficulty of attaining it; (b) unpleasantness of a potential negative outcome is a nonmonotonic function of perceived difficulty of avoiding it: (c) the nonmonotonic effect of perceived difficulty on goal at-tractiveness disappears once instrumental behavior has been completed; and (d)},

abstract = {The current study developed and tested a model of the interplay among goal difficulty, goal progress, and expectancy over time in influencing resource allocation toward competing demands. The results provided broad support for the theoretical model. As predicted, dual-goal expectancy-the perceived likelihood of meeting both goals in competition-played a central role, moderating the relationship between relative goal progress and resource allocation. Dual-goal difficulty was also found to exert an important influence on multiple-goal self-regulation. Although it did not influence total productivity across both tasks combined, it did combine with other model components to influence the relative emphasis of one task over another. These results suggest that the cumulative demands placed by multiple difficult goals may exceed individuals' perceived capabilities and may lead to partial or total abandonment of 1 goal to ensure attainment of the other. The model helps shed light on some of the conflicting theoretical propositions and empirical results obtained in prior work. Implications for theory and research regarding multiple-goal self-regulation are discussed.},

In the following sections, we review research findings for specific areas of supervisory control of unmanned air vehicles, unmanned ground vehicles, and heterogeneous UVs (i.e., using different types of UVs in the same mission). In the last section, we review innovative techniques and technologies designed to enhance operator performance and reduce potential performance degradations identified in the literature. 15.},

Randomly assigned experimental participants attended 8 behavioral-modeling workshop sessions over 2½ weeks. The manipulation check showed that training boosted GSE as intended. The workshop also increased job-search activity, confirming the hypothesis that raising GSE motivates intensification of effort. The treatment increased reemployment among participants low in initial GSE but not among those with high GSE. The greater plasticity of individuals low in GSE suggests that the practical utility of training is moderated by initial GSE. The authors conclude that individuals of low GSE should be given priority access to scarce behavioral-modeling training resources.},

abstract = {Team cognition has been identified as a critical component of team performance and decision-making. However, theory and research in this domain continues to remain largely static; articulation and examination of the dynamic processes through which collectively held knowledge emerges from the individual-to the team-level is lacking. To address this gap, we advance and systematically evaluate a process-oriented theory of team knowledge emergence. First, we summarize the core concepts and dynamic mechanisms that underlie team knowledge-building and represent our theory of team knowledge emergence (Step 1). We then translate this narrative theory into a formal computational model that provides an explicit specification of how these core concepts and mechanisms interact to produce emergent team knowledge (Step 2). The computational model is next instantiated into an agent-based simulation to explore how the key generative process mechanisms described in our theory contribute to improved knowledge emergence in teams (Step 3). Results from the simulations demonstrate that agent teams generate collectively shared knowledge more effectively when members are capable of processing information more efficiently and when teams follow communication strategies that promote equal rates of information sharing across members. Lastly, we conduct an empirical experiment with real teams participating in a collective knowledge-building task to verify that promoting these processes in human teams also leads to improved team knowledge emergence (Step 4). Discussion focuses on implications of the theory for examining team cognition processes and dynamics as well as directions for future research. Since the concept of team cognition was first proposed and popularized in the organizational sciences (Cannon-Bowers, Salas, {\&} Converse, 1990), an abundance of empirical research has accu-mulated examining its contribution to team effectiveness. Team cognition has been evaluated as both shared mental models (col-lectively shared mental representations of a team domain and task) as well as transactive memory systems (collectively distributed and organized knowledge related to team and task demands), and there is now meta-analytic evidence supporting the contribution of both conceptualizations to team performance (DeChurch {\&} Mesmer-Magnus, 2010).

abstract = {Operators currently controlling unmanned aerial vehicles report significant boredom, and such systems will likely become more automated in the future. Similar problems are found in process control, commercial aviation and medical settings.To examine the effect of boredom in such settings, a long-duration low-task-load experiment was conducted. Three low-task-load levels requiring operator input every 10, 20 or 30min were tested in a 4-h study, using a multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for sometimes-imperfect vehicle scheduling. Reaction times to system-generated events generally decreased across the 4 h, as did participants' ability to maintain directed attention. Overall, the participants spent almost half of the time in a distracted state. The top performer spent the majority of time in directed and divided attention states. Unexpectedly, the second-best participant, only 1{\%} worse than the top performer, was distracted for almost one-third of the experiment, but exhibited a periodic switching strategy, allowing himself to pay just enough attention to assist the automationwhenneeded. Indeed, four of the five top performers were distracted for more than one-third of the time. These findings suggest that distraction due to boring, low-task-load environments can be effectively managed through efficient attention switching. Futurework is needed to determine optimal frequency and duration of attention state switches, given various exogenous attributes, as well as individual variability. These findings have implications for the design of and personnel selection for supervisory control systems where operators monitor highly automated systems for long durations with only occasional or rare input.},

The predictions were tested in 2 probabilistic inference experiments. Exp I (13 college students) utilized stimuli with 1 or 3 binary Ds, and Exp II (36 Ss) utilized stimuli with 5 binary dimensions. Ss in Exp II were either under time pressure or not and were paid according to either an extreme or a moderate payoff rule. The predictions were generally sustained, but there were specific violations in terms of sequential effects and systematic patterns of D dependence, such that restructure of the basic theory is necessary. It is suggested that processing occurs in 2 stages, one leading to a tentative binary decision and the other to a degree of confidence in the choice. In the 2nd stage, Ds are processed sequentially and configurally with the bias toward the choice already made. (38 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results from a longitudinal diary study and 2 experiments show that positive and negative goal-related emotions can have diametrically opposing effects on goal-directed behavior, depending on the individual's proximity to goal attainment. The findings resolve contrasting predictions about the influence of positive and negative emotions in volitional behavior, critically amend the goal gradient hypothesis, and provide new insights into the dynamics and determinants of multiple-goal pursuit.},

We evaluate 20 probabilistic models of intertemporal choice using binary choice data from two large-scale experiments. Our analysis documents the interplay between heterogeneity and parsimony in accounting for empirical data: We find evidence for heterogeneity across individuals and across stimulus sets that can be accommodated with transitive models of varying complexity. We do not find systematic violations of transitivity in our data. Future work should continue to tackle the complex trade-off between parsimony and heterogeneity.},

Based on the integrative complexity model of group decision-making and the literature on intergroup social dilemmas, we argue that a lack of quality group discussion (i.e., low integrative complexity) can heighten group members' sense of greed toward and fear of other groups—and, by doing so, increase the likelihood that a group will decide to compete. Accordingly, we propose and evaluate two interventions that target group-discussion dynamics to promote the integrative complexity of group discussion and intergroup cooperation: structured group discussion and discussion led by a group member who favors cooperation. Two hundred eighty-five participants were assigned to groups of three and played an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. Results demonstrate that participating in a structured group discussion increased the integrative complexity of group discussion, during which different perspectives were fully deliberated before making a final decision. This, in turn, decreased the sense of greed and fear, and reduced the likelihood that a group would decide to compete against other groups. In contrast, a cooperative discussion leader was only helpful in reducing group decisions to compete in the first round: Because it did not increase the integrative complexity of group discussion, this method failed to motivate cooperation over time.

The estimate of the effect size here is a function of the Bayes factor, showing that estimation and model comparison can be unified. The salient difference is that common Bayes factor approaches provide for privileged consideration of theoretically useful parameter values, such as the value corresponding to the null hypothesis, while estimation approaches do not. Both approaches, either privileging the null or not, are useful depending on the goals of the analyst.},

abstract = {Six studies explore the role of goal shielding in self-regulation by examining how the activation of focal goals to which the individual is committed inhibits the accessibility of alternative goals. Consistent evidence was found for such goal shielding, and a number of its moderators were identified: Individuals' level of commitment to the focal goal, their degree of anxiety and depression, their need for cognitive closure, and differences in their goal-related tenacity. Moreover, inhibition of alternative goals was found to be more pronounced when they serve the same overarching purpose as the focal goal, but lessened when the alternative goals facilitate focal goal attainment. Finally, goal shielding was shown to have beneficial consequences for goal pursuit and attainment.},

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}Competition between individuals permeates people's lives as they strive for limited resources, services, and status. However, research on competition and competitiveness in organizations is limited despite its relevance to relational dynamics (e.g., rivalry), individual differences (e.g., traits, gender), social factors (e.g., competitive climate) and organizational outcomes (e.g., work performance, unethical behavior). In this article, we propose a multilevel model of competition and competitiveness that includes the individual, the group, and the situation. By providing a holistic overview of research across a broad array of disciplines, we organize the field and create a usable framework to advance knowledge of competition and competitiveness. In doing so, we identify what we know, what we still need to discover, and provide direction for future research. The article closes with an assessment of methods and measures used in studying competition. In conclusion, this review establishes a multilevel and integrative structure that incorporates individual and team competitiveness with competitive situations that prompt competitive processes and important organizational outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Adaptive functioning is thought to reflect a balance between approach and avoidance neural systems with imbalances often producing pathological forms of avoidance. Yet little evidence is available in healthy adults demonstrating a balance between approach and avoidance neural systems and modulation in avoidance neurocircuitry by vulnerability factors for avoidance. Consequently, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare changes in brain activation associated with human avoidance and approach learning and modulation of avoidance neurocircuitry by experiential avoidance. fMRI tracked trial-by-trial increases in activation while adults learned through trial and error an avoidance response that prevented money loss and an approach response that produced money gain. Avoidance and approach cues elicited similar experience-dependent increases in activation in a fronto-limbic-striatal network. Positive and negative reinforcing outcomes (i.e., money gain and avoidance of loss) also elicited similar increases in activation in frontal and striatal regions. Finally, increased experiential avoidance and self-punishment coping was associated with decreased activation in medial/superior frontal regions, anterior cingulate, amygdala and hippocampus. These findings suggest avoidance and approach learning recruit a similar fronto-limbic-striatal network in healthy adults. Increased experiential avoidance also appears to be associated with reduced frontal and limbic reactivity in avoidance, establishing an important link between maladaptive avoidance coping and altered responses in avoidance neurocircuitry.},

abstract = {Most past research on sequential sampling mod-els of decision-making have assumed a time homogeneous process (i.e., parameters such as drift rates and boundaries are constant and do not change during the deliberation pro-cess). This has largely been due to the theoretical difficulty in testing and fitting more complex models. In recent years, the development of simulation-based modeling approaches matched with Bayesian fitting methodologies has opened the possibility of developing more complex models such as those with time-varying properties. In the present work, we discuss a piecewise variant of the well-studied diffu-sion decision model (termed pDDM) that allows evidence accumulation rates to change during the deliberation pro-cess. Given the complex, time-varying nature of this model, standard Bayesian parameter estimation methodologies can-not be used to fit the model. To overcome this, we apply a recently developed simulation-based, hierarchal Bayesian methodology called the probability density approximation (PDA) method. We provide an analysis of this methodology and present results of parameter recovery experiments to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of this approach. With those established, we fit pDDM to data from a per-ceptual experiment where information changes during the course of trials. This extensible modeling platform opens the possibility of applying sequential sampling models to a range of complex non-stationary decision tasks.},

abstract = {In psychology as elsewhere, the main statistical inference strategy to establish empirical effects is null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The recent failure to replicate allegedly well-established NHST-results, however, implies that such results lack sufficient statistical power, and thus feature unacceptably high error-rates. Using data-simulation to estimate the error-rates of NHST-results, we advocate the research program strategy (RPS) as a superior methodology. RPS integrates Frequentist with Bayesian inference elements, and leads from a preliminary discovery against a (random) H0-hypothesis to a statistical H1-verification. Not only do RPS-results feature significantly lower error-rates than NHST-results, RPS also addresses key-deficits of a “pure” Frequentist and a standard Bayesian approach. In particular, RPS aggregates underpowered results safely. RPS therefore provides a tool to regain the trust the discipline had lost along the ongoing replicability-crisis.},

It was found that, for many people within the scientific community, there was a widespread belief that the general public were unable to conceptualize uncertainties associated with risk management processes. Many scientists thought that providing the public with information about uncertainty would increase distrust in science and scientific institutions, as well as cause panic and confusion regarding the extent and impact of a particular hazard. It was concluded that scientists still appear to be subscribing to the deficit model of science communication, and it is vital that effective mechanisms for communicating about risk uncertainty with the public must be developed as a matter of urgency, particularly as increased transparency in risk management processes means that scientific uncertainties associated with risk analysis become more likely to be the subject of public scrutiny and debate.},

These assump-tions influence the nature of theoretical constructs and propositions and should, ideally, also influence data collection, analysis, and in-terpretation. Greater attention to levels issues will strengthen orga-nizational theory development and research. Consider a levels-of-analysis issue arising in contemporary Ameri-can politics: How should electoral college votes be allocated In the pres-idential election? Currently, electoral college votes are allocated at the state level in all but two states (Maine and Nebraska). Thus, in 48 states, the candidate who wins the state's popular vote wins all of that state's electoral college votes. Some states are now considering a shift to the congressional district level. Like Maine and Nebraska, these states may decide that the candidate who wins a congressional district's popular vote wins all of that district's electoral college votes. Is this shift in level of analysis from state to district a big deal? Yes, indeed. Had electoral college votes been universally allocated at the congressional district level of analysis, Nixon would have beaten Kennedy in 1960 and Ford would have beaten Carter in 1976 (WiU, 1992).

abstract = {Unplanned optional stopping rules have been criticized for inflating Type I error rates under the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm. Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50{\%} to 70{\%} smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.},

There are, however, a number of alternative mechanisms that would produce the same statistical results, thus throwing into question whether inclusion of control variables has led to more or less accurate interpretation of results. The authors propose that researchers should be explicit rather than implicit regarding the role of control variables and match hypotheses precisely to both the choice of variables and the choice of analyses. The authors further propose that researchers avoid testing models in which demographic variables serve as proxies for variables that are of real theoretical interest in their data.},

abstract = {People with higher IQ scores also tend to perform better on elementary cognitive-perceptual tasks, such as deciding quickly whether an arrow points to the left or the right Jensen (2006). The worst performance rule (WPR) finesses this relation by stating that the association between IQ and elementary-task performance is most pronounced when this performance is summarized by people's slowest responses. Previous research has shown that the WPR can be accounted for in the Ratcliff diffusion model by assuming that the same ability parameter-drift rate-mediates performance in both elementary tasks and higher-level cog-nitive tasks. Here we aim to test four qualitative predictions concerning the WPR and its diffusion model explanation in terms of drift rate. In the first stage, the diffusion model was fit to data from 916 participants completing a perceptual two-choice task; crucially, the fitting happened after randomly shuffling the key variable, i.e., each participant's score on a working memory capacity test. In the second stage, after all modeling decisions were made, the key variable was unshuffled and the adequacy of the predictions was evaluated by means of confirmatory Bayesian hypothesis tests. By temporarily withholding the mapping of the key predictor, we retain flexibility for proper modeling of the data (e.g., outlier exclusion) while preventing biases from unduly influencing the results. Our results provide evidence against the WPR and suggest that it may be less robust and less ubiquitous than is commonly believed. Over the past decades, the field of mental chronometry has revealed several robust associations between high-level cog-nitive ability (e.g., IQ, working memory) and response times (RT) in elementary cognitive-perceptual tasks (Jensen, 2006; Van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2011). The main finding is that people with relatively high IQ-scores tend to respond relatively quickly in simple RT tasks that do not appear to involve deep cognitive processing; one example of such a task is the random dot kinematogram, which requires participants to detect the direction of apparent motion in a cloud of dot stimuli. Another important finding is known as the worst performance rule (WPR): the fact that the worst performance in these simple tasks-that is, the slowest responses-is most indicative of high-level cognitive ability (Baumeister and Kellas, 1968; Larson {\&} Alderton, 1990). In this study, we aimed to assess the presence and intensity of the WPR in a large data set. In addition, we test a prediction from the Rat-cliff diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff et al., 2008), namely that speed of information processing is the factor that underlies the WPR. In order to ensure that our statistical assessment is fair (e.g., unaffected by hindsight bias or confirmation bias), we first preregistered our entire analysis plan and submitted it},

The creation of the cognitive aspects of the model with ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) required us to conduct studies with subject matter experts to identify the experiential adaptations pilots bring to taxiing. Five decision strategies were found, ranging from cognitively intensive but precise to fast and frugal but robust. We provide evidence for the model by comparing its behavior to a National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center simulation of Chicago O'Hare surface operations. Decision horizons were highly variable; the model selected the most accurate strategy given the time available. We found a signature in the simulation data of the use of globally robust heuristics to cope with short decision horizons as revealed by the errors occurring most frequently at atypical taxiway geometries or clearance routes. These data provided empirical support for the model.},

The present research addresses this important multidisciplinary question by conducting a meta-analysis of existing empirical work and by proposing a new conceptual model--the opposing processes model of competition and performance. This model was tested by conducting an additional meta-analysis and 3 new empirical studies. The first meta-analysis revealed that there is no noteworthy relation between competition and performance. The second meta-analysis showed, in accord with the opposing processes model, that the absence of a direct effect is the result of inconsistent mediation via achievement goals: Competition prompts performance-approach goals which, in turn, facilitate performance; and competition also prompts performance-avoidance goals which, in turn, undermine performance. These same direct and mediational findings were also observed in the 3 new empirical studies (using 3 different conceptualizations of competition and attending to numerous control variables). Our findings provide both interpretational clarity regarding past research and conceptual guidance regarding future research on the competition-performance relation.},

While the results reveal positive incentive effects only under specific conditions, the exact nature, and the contribution of mediating factors are largely unexplored. The present study examined influences of payoff schemes as one of these factors. In particular, we manipulated penalties for errors and slow responses in a speeded categorization task. The data show improved performance for monetary over symbolic incentives when (a) penalties are higher for slow responses than for errors, and (b) neither slow responses nor errors are punished. Conversely, payoff schemes with stronger punishment for errors than for slow responses resulted in worse performance under monetary incentives. The findings suggest that an emphasis of speed is favorable for positive influences of monetary incentives, whereas an emphasis of accuracy under time pressure has the opposite effect.},

abstract = {Decision-making invokes two fundamental axes of control: affect or valence, spanning reward and punishment, and effect or action, spanning invigoration and inhibition. We studied the acquisition of instrumental responding in healthy human volunteers in a task in which we orthogonalized action requirements and outcome valence. Subjects were much more successful in learning active choices in rewarded conditions, and passive choices in punished conditions. Using computational reinforcement-learning models, we teased apart contributions from putatively instrumental and Pavlovian components in the generation of the observed asymmetry during learning. Moreover, using model-based fMRI, we showed that BOLD signals in striatum and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) correlated with instrumentally learnt action values, but with opposite signs for go and no-go choices. Finally, we showed that successful instrumental learning depends on engagement of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Our behavioral and computational data showed that instrumental learning is contingent on overcoming inherent and plastic Pavlovian biases, while our neuronal data showed this learning is linked to unique patterns of brain activity in regions implicated in action and inhibition respectively.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The goal of this article is to investigate how human participants allocate their limited time to decisions with different properties. We report the results of two behavioral experiments. In each trial of the experiments, the participant must accumulate noisy information to make a decision. The participants received positive and negative rewards for their correct and incorrect decisions, respectively. The stimulus was designed such that decisions based on more accumulated information were more accurate but took longer. Therefore, the total outcome that a participant could achieve during the limited experiments' time depended on her ''decision threshold " , the amount of information she needed to make a decision. In the first experiment, two types of trials were intermixed randomly: hard and easy. Crucially, the hard trials were associated with smaller positive and negative rewards than the easy trials. A cue presented at the beginning of each trial would indicate the type of the upcoming trial. The optimal strategy was to adopt a small decision threshold for hard trials. The results showed that several of the participants did not learn this simple strategy. We then investigated how the participants adjusted their decision threshold based on the feed-back they received in each trial. To this end, we developed and compared 10 computational models for adjusting the decision threshold. The models differ in their assumptions on the shape of the decision thresholds and the way the feedback is used to adjust the decision thresholds. The results of Bayesian model comparison showed that a model with time-varying thresholds whose parameters are updated by a reinforcement learning algorithm is the most likely model. In the second experiment, the cues were not presented. We showed that the optimal strategy is to use a single time-decreasing decision threshold for all trials. The results of the computational modeling showed that the participants did not use this optimal strategy. Instead, they attempted to detect the difficulty of the trial first and then set their decision threshold accordingly.},

Given the lack of research in this domain, this study proposes goal-setting theory, one of the most well-established motivational theories in psychology, as a framework by which to understand these effects. In this study, a classic brainstorming task is gamified with a leaderboard in order to explore this. Participants were randomly assigned to four classic levels of goal-setting (do-your-best, easy, difficult and impossible goals) plus a leaderboard populated with initials and scores representing identical goal-setting conditions. The presence of a leaderboard was successful in motivating participants to performance levels similar to that of difficult and impossible goal-setting, suggesting participants implicitly set goals at or near the top of the leaderboard without any prompting to do so. Goal commitment, a common individual difference moderator in goal-setting theory, was also assessed and behaved similarly in the presence of the leaderboard as when traditional goals were provided. From these results, we conclude that goal-setting theory is valuable to understand the success of leaderboards, and we recommend further exploration of existing psychological theories, including goal-setting, to better explain the effects of gamification.},

In standard applications, the rate at which information is accumulated by the diffusion process is assumed to be normally distributed across trials, the starting point for the process is assumed to be uniformly distributed across trials, and the time taken by processes outside the diffusion process is assumed to be uniformly distributed. With the studies in this article, I explore the consequences of alternative assumptions about the distributions, using a wide range of parameter values. The model with the standard assumptions was fit to predictions generated with the alternative assumptions, and the results showed that the recovered parameter values matched the values used to generate the predictions with only a few exceptions. These occurred when parameter combinations were extreme and when a skewed distribution (exponential) of nondecision times was used. The conclusion is that the standard model is robust to moderate changes in the across-trial distributions of parameter values.},

abstract = {Scientists who study cognition infer underlying processes either by observing behavior (e.g., response times, percentage correct) or by observing neural activity (e.g., the BOLD response). These two types of observations have traditionally supported two separate lines of study. The first is led by cognitive modelers, who rely on behavior alone to support their computational theories. The second is led by cognitive neuroimagers, who rely on statistical models to link patterns of neural activity to experimental manipulations, often without any attempt to make a direct connection to an explicit computational theory. Here we present a flexible Bayesian framework for combining neural and cognitive models. Joining neuroimaging and computational modeling in a single hierarchical framework allows the neural data to influence the parameters of the cognitive model and allows behavioral data, even in the absence of neural data, to constrain the neural model. Critically, our Bayesian approach can reveal interactions between behavioral and neural parameters, and hence between neural activity and cognitive mechanisms. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with applications to simulated fMRI data with a recognition model and to diffusion-weighted imaging data with a response time model of perceptual choice.},

abstract = {The rationality of decision making under risk is of central concern in psychology and other behavioral sciences. In real-life, the information relevant to a decision often arrives sequentially or changes over time, implying nontrivial demands on memory. Yet, little is known about how this affects the ability to make rational decisions and a default assumption is rather that information about outcomes and probabilities are simultaneously available at the time of the decision. In 4 experiments, we show that participants receiving probability- and outcome information sequentially report substantially (29 to 83{\%}) higher certainty equivalents than participants with simultaneous presentation. This holds also for monetary-incentivized participants with perfect recall of the information. Participants in the sequential conditions often violate stochastic dominance in the sense that they pay more for a lottery with low probability of an outcome than participants in the simultaneous condition pay for a high probability of the same outcome. Computational modeling demonstrates that Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky {\&} Kahneman, 1992) fails to account for the effects of sequential presentation, but a model assuming anchoring-and adjustment constrained by memory can account for the data. By implication, established assumptions of rationality may need to be reconsidered to account for the effects of memory in many real-life tasks.

We investigated whether this type of overconfidence is moderated by how task-relevant information is obtained. We contrast cases in which individuals were presented with information about two options with equal average performance – one with low variance the other with high variance – in experience format (i.e., observed individual performance outcomes sequentially) or description format (i.e., presented with a summary of the outcome distribution). Across three experiments, we found that those learning from description tended to be over-precise whereas those learning from experience were under-precise. These differences were driven by a relatively better calibrated representation of the underlying outcome distribution by those presented with experience-based information. We argue that those presented with experience-based information have better learning due to more opportunities for prediction-error.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Does the manner in which people acquire information affect their choices? Recent research has contrasted choices based on summary descriptions (e.g. a 100{\%} chance of {\$}3 vs. an 80{\%} chance of {\$}4) with those based on the 'experience' of drawing samples from environments that do (or should) match those provided by descriptions. Intriguingly, decision-makers' preferences differ markedly across the two formats: the so-called description-experience "gap" - but debate over the cause of this gap continues. We employed novel techniques to ensure strict control over both external and internal biases in the samples of information that people used to make decisions from experience. In line with some other recent research, we found a much diminished gap in both experiments suggesting that the divergence in choices based on description and sequentially acquired (non-consequential) samples is largely the result of non-equivalent information at the point of choice. The implications for models of risky choice are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The effect did not vary with age. The effect was weaker for boys (r = .12) compared to girls (r = .30). ToM was more strongly associated with popularity (r = .23) than with rejection (r = .13). These findings confirm that ToM development has significant implications for children's peer relationships.},

abstract = {For many decades, research in judgment and decision making has examined behavioral violations of rational choice theory. In that framework, rationality is expressed as a single correct decision shared by experimenters and subjects that satisfies internal coherence within a set of preferences and beliefs. Outside of psychology, social scientists are now debating the need to modify rational choice theory with behavioral assumptions. Within psychology, researchers are debating assumptions about errors for many different definitions of rationality. Alternative frameworks are being proposed. These frameworks view decisions as more reasonable and adaptive that previously thought. For example, "rule following." Rule following, which occurs when a rule or norm is applied to a situation, often minimizes effort and provides satisfying solutions that are "good enough," though not necessarily the best. When rules are ambiguous, people look for reasons to guide their decisions. They may also let their emotions take charge. This chapter presents recent research on judgment and decision making from traditional and alternative frameworks.},

abstract = {The past 20 years have witnessed unprecedented progress in brain– computer interfaces (BCIs). However, low communication rates re- main key obstacles to BCI-based communication in humans. This study presents an electroencephalogram-based BCI speller that can achieve information transfer rates (ITRs) up to 5.32 bits per second, the highest ITRs reported in BCI spellers using either noninvasive or invasive methods. Based on extremely high consistency of frequency and phase observed between visual flickering signals and the elicited single-trial steady-state visual evoked potentials, this study devel- oped a synchronous modulation and demodulation paradigm to implement the speller. Specifically, this study proposed a new joint frequency-phase modulation method to tag 40 characters with 0.5- s-long flickering signals and developed a user-specific target identi- fication algorithm using individual calibration data. The speller achieved high ITRs in online spelling tasks. This study demonstrates that BCIs can provide a truly naturalistic high-speed communication channel using noninvasively recorded brain activities.},

abstract = {In order to make good decisions, individuals need to identify and properly integrate information about various attributes associated with a choice. Since choices are often complex and made rapidly, they are typically affected by contextual variables that are thought to influence how much attention is paid to different attributes. I propose a modification of the attentional drift-diffusion model, the binary-attribute attentional drift diffusion model (baDDM), which describes the choice process over simple binary-attribute choices and how it is affected by fluctuations in visual attention. Using an eye-tracking experiment, I find the baDDM makes accurate quantitative predictions about several key variables including choices, reaction times, and how these variables are correlated with attention to two attributes in an accept-reject decision. Furthermore, I estimate an attribute-based fixation bias that suggests attention to an attribute increases its subjective weight by 5{\%}, while the unattended attribute's weight is decreased by 10{\%}.},

abstract = {The number and type of unmanned vehicles sought in military operations continues to grow. A critical consideration in designing these systems is identifying interface types or interaction schemes that enhance an operator's ability to supervise multiple unmanned vehicles. Past research has explored how interface types impact overall performance measures (e.g. mission execution time), but has not extensively examined other human performance factors that might influence human-robot interaction. Within a dynamic military environment, it is particularly important to assess how interfaces impact an operator's ability to quickly adapt and alter the unmanned vehicle's tasking. To assess an operator's ability to confront this changing environment, we explored the impact of interface type on task switching. Research has shown performance costs (i.e. increased time response) when individuals switch between different tasks. Results from this study suggest that this task switching effect is also seen when participants controlling multiple unmanned vehicles switch between different strategies. Results also indicate that when utilizing a flexible delegation interface, participants did not incur as large a switch cost effect as they did when using an interface that allowed only the use of fixed automated control of the unmanned vehicles.

Rather than judging others on their merits, even when such knowledge is free, we judge based on the opinions of third parties. Here we seek to understand this observation in the context of the evolution of cooperation. If individuals are being judged on noisy social reputations rather than on merit, then agents might exploit this, eroding the sustainability of cooperation. We employ a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Donation game, which has been used to simulate the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity. First, we validate the proposition that adding homophily (the propensity to interact with others of similar beliefs) into a society increases the sustainability of cooperation. However, this creates an evolutionary conflict between the accurate signalling of ingroup status versus the veridical report of the behaviour of other agents. We find that conditions exist where signalling ingroup status outweighs honesty as the best method to ultimately spread cooperation.},

abstract = {Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a part of the brain's limbic system. Classically, this region has been related to affect, on the basis of lesion studies in humans and in animals. In the late 1980s, neuroimaging research indicated that ACC was active in many studies of cognition. The findings from EEG studies of a focal area of negativity in scalp electrodes following an error response led to the idea that ACC might be the brain's error detection and correction device. In this article, these various findings are reviewed in relation to the idea that ACC is a part of a circuit involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing. Neuroimaging studies showing that separate areas of ACC are involved in cognition and emotion are discussed and related to results showing that the error negativity is influenced by affect and motivation. In addition, the development of the emotional and cognitive roles of ACC are discussed, and how the success of this regulation in controlling responses might be correlated with cingulate size. Finally, some theories are considered about how the different subdivisions of ACC might interact with other cortical structures as a part of the circuits involved in the regulation of mental and emotional activity.},

abstract = {Technical developments in computer hardware and software now make it possible to introduce automation into virtually all aspects of human-machine systems. Given these technical capabilities, which system functions should be automated and to what extent? We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for making such choices. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

Moreover, we show that there is a strong magnitude effect, in the sense that the effect of delay depends on themagnitude of the outcome. The results are consistent with the recently introduced probability time trade-off (PTT) model by Baucells and Heukamp.

abstract = {This article examines how people depart from optimality during multiple-goal pursuit. The authors operationalized optimality using dynamic programming, which is a mathematical model used to calculate expected value in multistage decisions. Drawing on prospect theory, they predicted that people are risk-averse when pursuing approach goals and are therefore more likely to prioritize the goal in the best position than the dynamic programming model suggests is optimal. The authors predicted that people are risk-seeking when pursuing avoidance goals and are therefore more likely to prioritize the goal in the worst position than is optimal. These predictions were supported by results from an experimental paradigm in which participants made a series of prioritization decisions while pursuing either 2 approach or 2 avoidance goals. This research demonstrates the usefulness of using decision-making theories and normative models to understand multiple-goal pursuit.},

abstract = {Regulatory focus theory (RFT; Higgins, 1997) may help to address the issue of motivation in cigarette smoking cessation. RFT suggests that individuals may be motivated to approach desired end-states (e.g., improved lung capacity) and/or avoid undesired end-states (e.g., illness). These motivations are referred to as promotion focus, in which people attempt to achieve their aspirations, and prevention focus, in which people are motivated to live up to responsibilities. According to RFT, smoking-related messages framed to match an individual's regulatory focus should be more effective than those that do not match. The current study attempted to prime promotion and prevention focus in a sample of cigarette smokers, to determine if priming impacts memory for smoking-related narratives. We expected that participants in the promotion-focus condition would outperform those in the prevention-focus condition on recall of materials reflecting approach strategies, whereas those in the prevention-focus condition would score better on recall of vignettes depicting avoidance. This hypothesis was not supported. There was, however, a significant interaction between participants' recall of vignettes depicting smoking vs. abstaining and approach vs. avoidance strategies, such that participants recalled smoking vignettes better when the described-person's goal was smoking to avoid an undesired state and recalled abstaining vignettes better when the target's goal was to approach a desired state. Further research into how regulatory focus theory may apply to adult cigarette smokers is warranted.},

abstract = {With reduced radar signatures, increased endurance and the removal of humans from immediate threat, uninhabited (also known as unmanned) ae- rial vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable assets to militarized forces. UAVs require human guidance to varying degrees and often through several operators. However, with current military focus on stream- lining operations, increasing automation, and reducing manning, there has been an increasing effort to design systems such that the current many-to- one ratio of operators to vehicles can be inverted. An increasing body of literature has examined the effectiveness of a single operator controlling multiple uninhabited aerial vehicles. While there have been numerous ex- perimental studies that have examined contextually how many UAVs a single operator could control, there is a distinct gap in developing predic- tive models for operator capacity. In this chapter, we will discuss previous experimental research for multiple UAV control, as well as previous at- tempts to develop predictive models for operator capacity based on tempo- ral measures. We extend this previous research by explicitly considering a cost-performance model that relates operator performance to mission costs and complexity. We conclude with a meta-analysis of the temporal meth- ods outlined and provide recommendation for future applications.},

abstract = {Parameter estimation in evidence-accumulation models of choice response times is demanding of both the data and the user. We outline how to fit evidence-accumulation models using the flexible, open-source, R-based Dynamic Models of Choice (DMC) software. DMC provides a hands-on introduction to the Bayesian implementation of two popular evidence-accumulation models: the diffusion decision model (DDM) and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA). It enables individual and hierarchical estimation, as well as assessment of the quality of a model's parameter estimates and descriptive accuracy. First, we introduce the basic concepts of Bayesian parameter estimation, guiding the reader through a simple DDM analysis. We then illustrate the challenges of fitting evidence-accumulation models using a set of LBA analyses. We emphasize best practices in modeling and discuss the importance of parameter-and model-recovery simulations, exploring the strengths and weaknesses of models in different experimental designs and parameter regions. We also demonstrate how DMC can be used to model complex cognitive processes, using as an example a race model of the stop-signal paradigm, which is used to measure inhibitory ability. We illustrate the flexibility of DMC by extending this model to account for mixtures of cognitive processes resulting from attention failures. We then guide the reader through the practical details of a Bayesian hierarchical analysis, from specifying priors to obtaining posterior distributions that encapsulate what has been learned from the data. Finally, we illustrate how the Bayesian approach leads to a quantitatively cumulative science, showing how to use posterior distributions to specify priors that can be used to inform the analysis of future experiments. Keywords Response time. Bayesian estimation. Diffusion decison model. Linear ballistic accumulator. Stop-signal paradigm In this article, we describe how to fit cognitive models of the process of evidence accumulation, in which evidence favoring different options is accumulated over time until a threshold is reached that triggers an associated response. There are many advantages to the evidence-accumulation approach, such as its abilities to specify a comprehensive account of the probability of each choice and the associated distribution of times to make them, and to provide parameter estimates that quantify latent (i.e., not directly observable) quantities of psychological interest (e.g., the quality of the evidence provided by a choice stimulus and the amount required to trigger a choice). As a result, these models have been widely adopted, with the two most prominent variants, the diffusion decision model (DDM; Ratcliff {\&} McKoon, 2008) and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA; Brown {\&} Heathcote, 2008) having been used in hundreds of articles with applications to a wide array of topics in animal cognition, psychology, and the neurosciences, including vision, attention, language, memory, cognition, emotion, development, aging, and clinical conditions, as well as applications in biology and economics (for reviews, see Mulder, van Maanen, {\&} Forstmann, 2014; Ratcliff, Smith, Brown, {\&} McKoon, 2016). Unfortunately, parameter estimation in the context of evidence-accumulation models can be challenging. We discuss below why this leads us to prefer a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation, and we provide flexible open-source software for this purpose. The Dynamic Models of Choice (DMC; osf.io/pbwx8) 1 software is written in R (R Core Team, 2016) and is accompanied by a series of tutorials that guide the user through the process of inferring parameters from data, and that also provide advice based on our experience (see Table 1 for an overview). In the first part of the article, we provide a basic introduction to Bayesian estimation of the most longstanding evidence-accumulation model of choice and response times (RTs), the DDM. We then illustrate the challenges associated with fitting evidence-accumulation models to data using the LBA, which, although developed more recently, has found wide application due to its computational tractability. In this illustration we explain best practices in cognitive modeling, such as parameter-and model-recovery simulations that address these challenges. These practices can be adapted by users to explore the strengths and weaknesses of any of the many different types of evidence-accumulation models implemented in DMC in the specific context of the experimental design and parameter region relevant to their own research. Evidence-accumulation models have transcended their roots in simple decision processes and have provided the building blocks for more wide-ranging cognitive models. In the second part of this article, we explore a complex contingent-choice task; in particular, we focus on a type of contingent choice in which participants are required to withhold their response upon detecting a signal that occasionally appears after the choice stimulus. Race architectures have long been applied to this Bstop-signal{\^{}} paradigm in order to provide nonparametric estimates of the ability to stop (i.e., inhibit) ongoing responses (Logan {\&} Cowan, 1984; Logan, Cowan, {\&} Davis, 1984). More recently, these models have also been used to provide parametric accounts of response inhibition (Logan, Van Zandt, Verbruggen, {\&} Wagenmakers, 2014; Matzke, Dolan, Logan, Brown, {\&} Wagenmakers, 2013a) and to model failures to attend to the stop signal (Matzke, Love, {\&} Heathcote, 2017b). We use an extension of a parametric stop-signal model, proposed by Matzke, Curley, Gong, and Heathcote (2018a), to illustrate the power and flexibility of DMC to model complex cognitive processes. We provide the mathematical details of Matzke et al. (2017a, b) model, both because the same types of equations underpin many evidence-accumulation models and because they illustrate how easy it is to extend these models to account for mixtures of processes caused, for instance, by attention failures. We illustrate the advantages of Bayesian hierarchical modeling by applying it to experimental stop-signal data, and then show how to use the resulting parameter estimates to quantitatively inform the analysis of future experiments.},

abstract = {Simple heuristics are often regarded as tractable decision strategies because they ignore a great deal of information in the input data. One puzzle is why heuristics can outperform full-information models, such as linear regression, which make full use of the available information. These “less-is-more” effects, in which a relatively simpler model outperforms a more complex model, are prevalent throughout cognitive science, and are frequently argued to demonstrate an inherent advantage of simplifying computation or ignoring information. In contrast, we show at the computational level (where algorithmic restrictions are set aside) that it is never optimal to discard information. Through a formal Bayesian analysis, we prove that popular heuristics, such as tallying and take-the-best, are formally equivalent to Bayesian inference under the limit of infinitely strong priors. Varying the strength of the prior yields a continuum of Bayesian models with the heuristics at one end and ordinary regression at the other. Critically, intermediate models perform better across all our simulations, suggesting that down-weighting information with the appropriate prior is preferable to entirely ignoring it. Rather than because of their simplicity, our analyses suggest heuristics perform well because they implement strong priors that approximate the actual structure of the environment. We end by considering how new heuristics could be derived by infinitely strengthening the priors of other Bayesian models. These formal results have implications for work in psychology, machine learning and economics.},

abstract = {Consumers often pursue goals (e.g., losing weight) where the chance of attaining the goal increases with some behaviors (e.g., exercise) but decreases with others (e.g., eating). Although goal monitoring is known to be a critical step in self-control for successful goal pursuit, little research investigates whether consumers accurately monitor goal progress. Seven experiments demonstrate that consumers tend to show a progress bias in goal monitoring, perceiving that goal-consistent behaviors (e.g., saving {\$}45) help progress more than goal-inconsistent behaviors of the equivalent size (e.g., spending {\$}45) hurt it. Expectations of goal attainment moderate the progress bias; reducing the expectation that the goal will be reached reduces the tendency to perceive goal-consistent behaviors to have a larger impact on goal progress than equivalent goal-inconsistent behaviors. A study on exercise and eating shows that although the progress bias can increase initial goal persistence, it can also lead to premature goal release due to poor calibration of overall progress.},

abstract = {Computational models have become common tools in psychology. They provide quantitative instantiations of the-ories that seek to explain the functioning of the human mind. In this paper, we focus on identifying deep theoretical similarities between two very different models. Both models are concerned with how fatigue from sleep loss impacts cognitive processing. The first is based on the diffusion model and posits that fatigue decreases the drift rate of the diffusion process. The second is based on the Adaptive Control of Thought – Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture and posits that fatigue decreases the util-ity of candidate actions leading to microlapses in cognitive processing. A biomathematical model of fatigue is used to con-trol drift rate in the first account and utility in the second. We investigated the predicted response time distributions of these two integrated computational cognitive models for perfor-mance on a psychomotor vigilance test under conditions of total sleep deprivation, simulated shift work, and sustained sleep restriction. The models generated equivalent predictions of response time distributions with excellent goodness-of-fit to the human data. More importantly, although the accounts in-volve different modeling approaches and levels of abstraction, they represent the effects of fatigue in a functionally equivalent way: in both, fatigue decreases the signal-to-noise ratio in de-cision processes and decreases response inhibition. This con-vergence suggests that sleep loss impairs psychomotor vigi-lance performance through degradation of the quality of cogni-tive processing, which provides a foundation for systematic investigation of the effects of sleep loss on other aspects of cognition. Our findings illustrate the value of treating different modeling formalisms as vehicles for discovery.},

Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "time-reversing" well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed.},

abstract = {Choices between immediate and delayed consequences have been studied using mathematical models. Several studies have investigated this delay discounting phenomenon using appetitive stimuli, but few have studied it with aversive stimuli, although the models that describe the appetitive scenario have been suggested to also describe the aversive scenario. The aim of this study was to compare the delay discounting of gains and losses. Participants included 36 volunteers (undergraduate students; age range: 18–28 years) of both sexes. Informed consent was provided by participants. Data collection consisted of a series of hypothetical choices between immediate and delayed monetary amounts that would be earned (gain situation) and paid (loss situation): fixed delayed value of R{\$}1,000 and variable immediate value that could range from R{\$}1−R{\$}1,000. For each of 8 delays, an indifference point was calculated. The analysis of the mathematical models revealed that the models found in the literature failed to describe the data obtained for losses. An alternative model is proposed, in which the aversive value of the delay is modulated by 2 parameters that are added to a hyperbolic with exponent model. Such a model provides a better description of the present data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {The degree to which individuals prefer smaller sooner versus larger delayed rewards serves as a powerful predictor of their impulsivity towards a number of different kinds of rewards. Here we test the limits of its predictive ability within a variety of cognitive and social domains. Across several large samples of subjects, individuals who prefer smaller more immediate rewards (steeper discounters) are less reflective (or more impulsive) in their choices, preferences, and beliefs. First, steeper discounters used more automatic, less controlled choice strategies, giving more intuitive but incorrect responses on the Cognitive Reflection Test (replicating previous findings); employing a suboptimal probability matching heuristic for a one-shot gamble (rather than maximizing their probability of reward); and relying less on optimal planning in a two-stage reinforcement learning task. Second, steeper discounters preferred to consume information that was less complex and multi-faceted, as suggested by their self-reported Need for Cognitive Closure, their use of short-form social media (i.e., Twitter), and their preferred news sources (in particular, whether or not they preferred National Public Radio over other news sources). Third, steeper discounters had interpersonal and religious beliefs that are associated with reduced epistemic complexity: they were more likely to believe that the behavior of others could be explained by fixed rather than dynamic factors, and they believed more strongly in God and in the afterlife. Together these findings provide evidence for a link between individual differences in temporal discounting for monetary rewards and preferences for the path of least resistance (less reflective and/or more automatic modes of processing) across a variety of domains.},

abstract = {'When calculating the rate at whic-h a future benefit is discounted, we must be careful to make allowance for the pleasures of expectation.' (Marshall, i89i, p. I78) Of the various assumptions underlying analyses of intertemporal choice, perhaps the assumption of positive discounting is the most widespread and noncontroversial. Empirical work which has sought to estimate individual discount rates (Hausman, I979; Landsberger, I971) has provided no grounds for questioning this assumption. In fact, a recent study which explicitly questioned the general applicability of positive discounting concluded that 'the case for positive time preference is absolutely compelling' (Olson and Bailey, I 98 I). Yet it requires little effort to think of examples of behaviour in which negative discounting is apparent. The pleasurable deferral of a vacation, the speeding up of a dental appointment, the prolonged storage of a bottle of expensive champagne are all instances of this phenomenon. Indeed, if R. H. Strotz had begun his work thirty years ago with behaviour such as this in mind, he might have developed a critique of Discounted Utility theory (DU) equally as compelling as his work on myopia but pointing towards research very different from what has actually ensued from his work. Instead, in introducing the broad concept of 'time inconsistency', Strotz devoted his attention exclusively to a subdomain of instances in which the economic actor behaves more myopically in the present than he previously had planned. While the focus on impulsivity has offered important theoretical insights it may have impeded recognition of the existence and interest of other phenomena, such as low or negative discounting. A more inclusive theory of intertemporal choice should be able to account for both extremes of behaviour -myopic and far-sighted. Such a model is proposed here. The model modifies DU by introducing an insight once recognised by economists: that anticipation of the future has an impact on immediate well-being.1 This observation can be traced to Bentham (I789), who included among the ingredients of utility, pleasures and pains that derive from antici-pation. For Bentham, anticipation, like consumption itself, was an important source of pleasure and pain. * I thank Robert Abelson, Richard Levin, Sidney Winter,John Geanakoplos, Howard Kunreuther, Colin Camerer, Mark Machina and Robin Pope for their helpful suggestions. The support of the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton. is gratefullv acknowledged. 1 In exploring the relationship between anticipation and time discounting, the current paper is akin to the recent work of Pope (1983), who examined the role of anticipation in risk aversion, and Wolf (1970), who discussed the implications for intertemporal choice of utility from memory.},

abstract = {Previous research, involving monetary rewards, found that limbic reward-related areas show greater activity when an intertemporal choice includes an immediate reward than when the options include only delayed rewards. In contrast, the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex (areas commonly associated with deliberative cognitive processes, including future planning) respond to intertemporal choices in general but do not exhibit sensitivity to immediacy (McClure et al., 2004). The current experiments extend these findings to primary rewards (fruit juice or water) and time delays of minutes instead of weeks. Thirsty subjects choose between small volumes of drinks delivered at precise times during the experiment (e.g., 2 ml now vs 3 ml in 5 min). Consistent with previous findings, limbic activation was greater for choices between an immediate reward and a delayed reward than for choices between two delayed rewards, whereas the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex responded similarly whether choices were between an immediate and a delayed reward or between two delayed rewards. Moreover, relative activation of the two sets of brain regions predicts actual choice behavior. A second experiment finds that when the delivery of all rewards is offset by 10 min (so that the earliest available juice reward in any choice is 10 min), no differential activity is observed in limbic reward-related areas for choices involving the earliest versus only more delayed rewards. We discuss implications of this finding for differences between primary and secondary rewards.},

abstract = {A decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on evidence and the expected costs and benefits associated with the outcome. Progress in a variety of fields has led to a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms that evaluate evidence and reach a decision. Several formalisms propose that a representation of noisy evidence is evaluated against a criterion to produce a decision. Without additional evidence, however, these formalisms fail to explain why a decision-maker would change their mind. Here we extend a model, developed to account for both the timing and the accuracy of the initial decision, to explain subsequent changes of mind. Subjects made decisions about a noisy visual stimulus, which they indicated by moving a handle. Although they received no additional information after initiating their movement, their hand trajectories betrayed a change of mind in some trials. We propose that noisy evidence is accumulated over time until it reaches a criterion level, or bound, which determines the initial decision, and that the brain exploits information that is in the processing pipeline when the initial decision is made to subsequently either reverse or reaffirm the initial decision. The model explains both the frequency of changes of mind as well as their dependence on both task difficulty and whether the initial decision was accurate or erroneous. The theoretical and experimental findings advance the understanding of decision-making to the highly flexible and cognitive acts of vacillation and self-correction.},

abstract = {Human information processing and task selection procedures in a dynamic multitask supervisory control environment are discussed. The results of a joint experimental and analytic program were assimilated into a normative dynamic-decision model for predicting human task-selection performance. To this end a general multitask experimental paradigm has been developed, wherein tasks of different value, time requirement, and deadline compete for a human's attention. Via this framework, the effects of various task related variables on human-decision processes have been studied empirically. Conceptually the normative dynamic-decision model (DDM) is an outgrowth of the well-known optimal control modeling (OCM) technology as applied to multitask situations. Thus the analytic framework of the DDM is rooted in modern control, estimation, and semi-Markov decision-process (SMDP) theories. In order to validate the model via comparison with experimental results, several time history and scalar measures of performance similarity are proposed. Excellent model-data agreement is obtained for all the experimental conditions studied. Moreover the model has been shown to perform significantly better than various heuristic sequencing rules of scheduling theory that neglect the inherent human information processing and decisionmaking limitations. {\textcopyright} 1983 IEEE},

But the estimated average replicability rate of key-effects that top-tier psychology journals report falls between 36{\%} and 39{\%} (objective vs. subjective rate; Open Science Collaboration (2015)). So the standard mode of applying null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) fails to adequately separate stable from random effects. Therefore, NHST does not fully convince as a statistical inference strategy. We argue that the replicability crisis is “home-made” because more sophisticated strategies can deliver results the successful replication of which is sufficiently probable. Thus, we can overcome the replicability crisis by integrating empirical results into genuine research programs. Instead of continuing to narrowly evaluate only the stability of data against random fluctuations (discovery context), such programs evaluate rival hypotheses against stable data (justification context).},

Martyn Plummer is guest editor for this special issue, which has a distinctly Bayesian flavour. Thanks to Martyn and his merry band of contributors and reviewers for getting this special is-sue together. Normal service and regular features will resume with a regular issue following the release of R 2.3.0. For now, sit back, relax, and prepare to gorge your-self on a feast of Bayes. This special issue of R News is dedicated to Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The choice of articles for this issue is subjective. We aim to give you a snapshot of some current work on Bayesian statistical comput-ing in R without any claim to comprehensiveness. A broader view is provided by the CRAN task view on Bayesian inference maintained by Jong Hee Park. This currently lists 33 packages, some of which have been discussed in previous R News articles (Yan, 2004; Raftery et al., 2005). MCMC has become the numerical method of choice for many Bayesians. Although computation-ally expensive, it enables highly complex probabil-ity models to be analyzed. This capability, com-bined with cheap, abundant computing power, has contributed to the increasing popularity of Bayesian methods in applied statistics. The field has now ma-tured to the point where most users should not ex-pect to write custom software, but may use one of several existing " sampling engines " . R provides a natural front end for these engines. This is nicely il-lustrated by the package MCMCpack, subject of the first article by Andrew Martin and Kevin Quinn. The computational back-end of MCMCpack is provided by the Scythe C++ statistical library. The front end is a collection of R functions for fitting models com-monly used in the social and behavioural sciences. This is followed by an article on coda, which pro-vides the infrastructure for analyzing MCMC output, and is used by MCMCpack among other packages. Samantha Cook and Andrew Gelman then dis-cuss validation of MCMC software using the BayesValidate package. Since the results of MCMC simulation are never exact, and the models used are typically very complex, validation of the sampling software can be quite difficult. However, the lack of validation of Bayesian software may be holding back its acceptance in regulated environments such as clinical trials approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, so this is an important problem.

While previous work has demonstrated the favorable impacts that arise in the introduction of increasingly sophisticated autonomy algorithms, little work has performed an explicit comparison of different types of multiple unmanned vehicle control architectures on operator performance and workload. This paper compares a vehicle-based paradigm (where a single operator individually as- signs tasks to unmanned assets) to a task-based paradigm (where the operator generates a task list, which is then given to the group of vehicles that determine how to best divide the tasks among themselves.) The results demonstrate significant advantages in us- ing a task-based paradigm for both overall performance and ro- bustness to increasedworkload. This effort also demonstrated that while previous video gaming experience mattered for performance, the degree of experience that demonstrated benefit was minimal. Further work should focus on designing a flexible automated sys- tem that allows operators to focus on a primary goal, but also facilitate lower level control when needed without degradation in performance.},

Using data collected from supervisor-subordinate dyads (Sample 1) and time-lagged data (Sample 2), we found that the results from two studies indicated that the interaction of workplace success and avoidance motivation orientation mediated relations of CSE with job satisfaction. Although approach motivation orientation did not interact with workplace success, it did mediate the CSE-job satisfaction relation on its own.

abstract = {Traditionally, descriptive accounts of intertemporal choice have relied on static and deterministic models that assume alternative-wise processing of the options. Recent research, by contrast, has highlighted the dynamic and probabilistic nature of intertemporal choice and provided support for attribute-wise processing. Currently, dynamic models of intertemporal choice—which account for both the resulting choice and the time course over which the construction of a choice develops—rely exclusively on the framework of evidence accumulation. In this article, we develop and rigorously compare several candidate schemes for dynamic models of intertemporal choice. Specifically, we consider an existing dynamic modeling scheme based on decision field theory and develop two novel modeling schemes—one assuming lexicographic, noncompensatory processing, and the other built on the classical concepts of random utility in economics and discrimination thresholds in psychophysics. We show that all three modeling schemes can accommodate key behavioral regularities in intertemporal choice. When empirical choice and response time data were fit simultaneously, the models built on random utility and discrimination thresholds performed best. The results also indicated substantial individual differences in the dynamics underlying intertemporal choice. Finally, model recovery analyses demonstrated the benefits of including both choice and response time data for more accurate model selection on the individual level. The present work shows how the classical concept of random utility can be extended to incorporate response dynamics in intertemporal choice. Moreover, the results suggest that this approach offers a successful alternative to the dominating evidence accumulation approach when modeling the dynamics of decision making.},

Normative theories focus on how to make the best decisions by deriving algebraic representations of preference from idealized behavioral axioms. Descriptive theories adopt this algebraic representation, but incorporate known limitations of human behavior. Computational approaches start from a different set of assumptions altogether, focusing instead on the underlying cognitive and emotional processes that result in the selection of one option over the other. This review comprehensively but concisely describes and contrasts three approaches in termsof their theoreticalassumptionsandtheirability toaccount forbehavioraland neurophysiological evidence from experimental research.Although each approach contributes substantially to our understanding of human decision making, we argue that the computational approach is more fruitful and parsimonious for describing and predicting choices in both laboratory and applied settings and for understanding the neurophysiological substrates of decision making.},

abstract = {This paper presents a theory of multi-alternative, multi-attribute preferential choice. It is assumed that the associations between an attribute and an available alternative impact the attribute's accessibility. The values of highly accessible attributes are more likely to be aggregated into preferences. Altering the choice task by adding new alternatives or by increasing the salience of preexisting alternatives can change the accessibility of the underlying attributes and subsequently bias choice. This mechanism is formalized by use of a preference accumulation decision process, embedded in a feed-forward neural network. The resulting model provides a unitary explanation for a large range of choice-set-dependent behaviors, including context effects, alignability effects, and less is more effects. The model also generates a gain–loss asymmetry relative to the reference point, without explicit loss aversion. This asymmetry accounts for all of the reference-dependent anomalies explained by loss aversion, as well as reference-dependent phenomena not captured by loss aversion.},

In Study 2, goal orientations and exam performance were measured across 3 time points while undergraduates completed a course. Mastery-approach orientation was positively related to performance at the intraindividual level, but not at the interindividual level, and its effect was not moderated by task demands. Performance-approach positively predicted performance at the interindividual level, and at the intraindividual level, the direction of its effect switched as a function of task demands. Performance-avoid negatively predicted performance at the interindividual level but did not emerge as an intraindividual predictor. Mastery-avoid did not relate to performance at either level of analysis. This consistent pattern across 2 studies suggests that levels of analysis and task demands can determine the magnitude and direction of goal orientation effects on performance and highlights avenues for theory development.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

As anticipated, safety knowledge and safety motivation were most strongly related to safety performance behaviors, closely followed by psychological safety climate and group safety climate. With regard to accidents and injuries, however, group safety climate had the strongest association. In addition, tests of a meta-analytic path model provided support for the theoretical model that guided this overall investigation.

A number of popular shortcut strategies in cognitive modeling do not properly accommodate this structure and can result in biased conclusions. To gauge the severity of these biases, we conducted a simulation study for a two-group experiment. We first considered a modeling strategy that ignores the hierarchical data structure. In line with theoretical results, our simulations showed that Bayesian and frequentist methods that rely on this strategy are biased towards the null hypothesis. Secondly, we considered a modeling strategy that takes a two-step approach by first obtaining participant-level estimates from a hierarchical cognitive model and subsequently using these estimates in a follow-up statistical test. Methods that rely on this strategy are biased towards the alternative hypothesis. Only hierarchical models of the multilevel data lead to correct conclusions. Our results are particularly relevant for the use of hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimates in cognitive modeling.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review and a model of the development of addictive behaviors in (human) adolescents, with a focus on alcohol. The model proposes that addictive behaviors develop as the result of an imbalance between two systems: an appetitive, approach-oriented system that becomes sensitized with repeated alcohol use and a regulatory executive system that is not fully developed and that is compromised by exposure to alcohol. Self-regulation critically depends on two factors: ability and motivation to regulate the appetitive response tendency. The motivational aspect is often still weak in heavy drinking adolescents, who typically do not recognize their drinking as problematic. Motivation to regulate use often develops only years later, after the individual has encountered serious alcohol-related problems. Unfortunately, at that point behavioral change becomes harder due to several neurocognitive adaptations that result from heavy drinking. As we document, there is preliminary support for the central elements of the model (appetitive motivation vs. self-regulation), but there is a paucity of research directly addressing these mechanisms in human adolescents. Further, we emphasize that adolescent alcohol use primarily takes place in a social context, and that therefore studies should not solely focus on intra-individual factors predicting substance use and misuse but also on interpersonal social factors. Finally, we discuss implications of the model for interventions.},

Individual differences in subjective effort could present a major and pervasive confound in behavioral and neuroscience assessments, by conflating cognitive ability with cognitive motivation. Self-report cognitive effort scales have been developed, but objective measures are lacking. In this study, we use the behavioral economic approach of revealed preferences to quantify subjective effort. Specifically, we adapted a well-established discounting paradigm to measure the extent to which cognitive effort causes participants to discount monetary rewards. The resulting metrics are sensitive to both within-individual factors, including objective load and reward amount, and between-individual factors, including age and trait cognitive engagement. We further validate cognitive effort discounting by benchmarking it against well-established measures of delay discounting. The results highlight the promise and utility of behavioral economic tools for assessing trait and state influences on cognitive motivation.},

abstract = {Researchers are often confused about what can be inferred from significance tests. One problem occurs when people apply Bayesian intuitions to significance testing—two approaches that must be firmly separated. This article presents some common situations in which the approaches come to different conclusions; you can see where your intuitions initially lie. The situations include multiple testing, deciding when to stop running participants, and when a theory was thought of relative to finding out results. The interpretation of nonsignificant results has also been persistently problematic in a way that Bayesian inference can clarify. The Bayesian and orthodox approaches are placed in the context of different notions of rationality, and I accuse myself and others as having been irrational in the way we have been using statistics on a key notion of rationality. The reader is shown how to apply Bayesian inference in practice, using free online software, to allow more coherent inferences from data. Psychology and other disciplines have benefited enormously from having a rigorous procedure for extracting inferences from data. The question this article raises is whether we could be doing it better. Two main approaches are contrasted: ortho-dox statistics versus the Bayesian approach. Around the 1940s, the heated debate between the two camps was momentarily won in terms of what users of statistics did: Users followed the approach systematized by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pear-son (at least this approach defined norms; in practice, researchers often followed the somewhat different advice of Ronald Fisher; see e.g., Gigerenzer, 2004). But it was not that the intellectual debate was decisively won. It was more a practical matter of which approach had the most well worked-out applications at the time and which approach was conceptually easier for the researcher to apply. But now the prac-tical problems have been largely solved; there is little to stop researchers from using the Bayesian approach in almost all circumstances. Thus the intellectual debate can be opened up again, and indeed it has (, despite the benefits it has also pro-vided. Indeed, I argue we would be most rational, under one intui-tively compelling notion of rationality, to be Bayesians.},

abstract = {A longstanding debate has recently re-erupted in the self-regulation literature around the concept of self-efficacy. This article presents an argument that the debate emerges from a lack of understanding of the history of control theories within both the social and physical sciences and the various levels of explanation to which phenomena can be subjected. This history, coupled with the issues of determinism, materialism, and empiricism evoked by the deeper level of explanation that some versions of control theory provide, has led some critics to mis-apply non-psychological properties to control theories and obscure their usefulness. Here, the usefulness of a deeper control theory level of explanation is illustrated using comparisons with explanations found in goal-setting theory and social cognitive theory.},

In this article, the authors present a new computational model that accounts for the empirical trends without changing decision weights, values, or combination rules. Rather, the current model specifies a dynamic evaluation and response process that correctly predicts preference orderings across 6 elicitation methods, retains stable evaluations across methods, and makes novel predictions regarding response distributions and response times.},

Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in-depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance--temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty--in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance. However, highlighting the potentially very serious distant impacts of climate change may also be useful in promoting sustainable behavior, even among those already concerned.},

ABSTRACT The level of EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) is determined by the duration of prior sleep and waking. SWA is a marker of nonREM sleep intensity and may serve as an indicator of sleep homeostasis. The two-process model of sleep regulation posits the interaction of the homeostatic Process S and the circadian Process C. Also models of neurobehavioral functions (three-process model; interactive models of alertness and cognitive throughput) are based on the concept of an interaction between homeostatic and circadian factors. Whether the interaction is linear or non-linear is still unresolved. Models may serve as a guiding principle for specifying the relationship between processes occurring at the macroscopic and microscopic level of analysis.},

The model gave a good account of all of the dependent variables--accuracy, correct and error response times, and their distributions--and provided a description of how the component processes involved in the lexical decision task were affected by experimental variables. All of the variables investigated affected the rate at which information was accumulated from the stimuli--called drift rate in the model. The different drift rates observed for the various classes of stimuli can all be explained by a 2-dimensional signal-detection representation of stimulus information. The authors discuss how this representation and the diffusion model's decision process might be integrated with current models of lexical access.},

They begin by analyzing 6 models of TAFC decision making and show that all but one can be reduced to the drift diffusion model, implementing the statistically optimal algorithm (most accurate for a given speed or fastest for a given accuracy). They prove further that there is always an optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy that maximizes various reward functions, including reward rate (percentage of correct responses per unit time), as well as several other objective functions, including ones weighted for accuracy. They use these findings to address empirical data and make novel predictions about performance under optimality. This article concerns optimal strategies for decision making in the two-alternative forced-choice (TAFC) task. We present and compare several decision-making models, briefly discuss their neural implementations, and relate them to one that is optimal in the sense that it delivers a decision of specified accuracy in the shortest possible time: the drift diffusion model (DDM). Further definitions of optimality, via objective functions such as reward rate (RR), are given below, and we provide explicit solutions to the speed–accuracy trade-off for the TAFC task.},

abstract = {The sunk cost effect is manifested in a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made. Evidence that the psychological justification for this behavior is predicated on the desire not to appear wasteful is presented. In a field study, customers who had initially paid more for a season subscription to a theater series attended more plays during the next 6 months, presumably because of their higher sunk cost in the season tickets. Several questionnaire studies corroborated and extended this finding. It is found that those who had incurred a sunk cost inflated their estimate of how likely a project was to succeed compared to the estimates of the same project by those who had not incurred a sunk cost. The basic sunk cost finding that people will throw good money after bad appears to be well described by prospect theory (D. Kahneman {\&} A. Tversky, 1979, Econometrica, 47, 263–291). Only moderate support for the contention that personal involvement increases the sunk cost effect is presented. The sunk cost effect was not lessened by having taken prior courses in economics. Finally, the sunk cost effect cannot be fully subsumed under any of several social psychological theories.},

@article{Turner2016,
abstract = {The need to test a growing number of theories in cognitive science has led to increased interest in inferential methods that integrate multiple data modalities. In this manuscript, we show how a method for integrating three data modalities within a single framework provides (1) more detailed descriptions of cognitive processes and (2) more accurate predictions of unobserved data than less integrative methods. Specifically, we show how combining either EEG and fMRI with a behavioral model can perform substantially better than a behavioral-data-only model in both generative and predictive modeling analyses. We then show how a trivariate model-a model including EEG, fMRI, and behavioral data-outperforms bivariate models in both generative and predictive modeling analyses. Together, these results suggest that within an appropriate modeling framework, more data can be used to better constrain cognitive theory, and to generate more accurate predictions for behav-ioral and neural data. The field of cognitive science is faced with many options for studying how experimentally-derived variables are systematically related to the dynamics underlying a cognitive process of interest. To date, much of our understanding of cognition has been advanced by two dominant, but non-interacting groups. The largest group, cognitive neuroscientists, rely on statistical models to understand patterns of neural activity. These models are typically purely data-mining techniques, and often disregard the computational mechanisms that might detail a cognitive process. The other group, mathematical psychologists, is strongly mo-tived by theoretical accounts of cognitive processes, and instantiates these theories by developing formal mathematical models of cognition. The models often assume a system of computations and equations intended to characterize the process assumed to take place in the brain. To formally test their theory, mathematical psychologists rely on their model's ability to fit behavioral data. A good fit is thought to reflect an accurate theory, whereas a bad fit would refute it. Although both groups are concerned with explaining behavior, they tend to approach the challenge from different vantage points. Thinking in terms of Marr's (1982) levels of analysis, mathematical psychologists tend to focus on the computational and algorithmic levels, whereas cognitive neuroscientists focus more on the implementation level. Although progress can be made by maintaining a tight focus on one level, certain opportunities are missed. As a result of their single-level focus, both approaches suffer from critical limitations (Love, 2015), and these limitations have inspired researchers to combine neural and behavioral measures in an integrative fashion. The primary payoff of this endeavor is the localization of mechanisms assumed to underly the computations supporting task-specific behavior within the brain. The importance of solving the integration problem has spawned several entirely new statistical modeling approaches developed through collaborations between mathematical psychologists and cognitive neurosci-entists, collectively forming a new field often referred to as "model-based cognitive neuroscience" (e. So far, the field of model-based cognitive neuroscience has established links between both structural measures such as diffusion-weighted imaging (Forstmann et al., 2010; Turner et al., 2013a), and functional measures such as electroencephalography (EEG; e.g., Nunez et al., 2015), functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI; e.g., (van Maanen et al.},

abstract = {Researchers have noted parallels between decisions under uncertainty and over time. Three experiments evaluated the theory that uncertainty and time affect choice via a common underlying dimension, such that delaying an outcome is equivalent to making it uncertain. To test this account we asked whether adding uncertainty to outcomes would eliminate the immediacy effect bias. We also asked whether adding time delay to outcomes would eliminate the certainty effect bias. The answer to both questions was yes, provided the prospects were presented singly rather than jointly. In single evaluation uncertainly eliminated the immediacy effect and delay eliminated one form of the certainty effect, while in joint evaluation, these effects did not occur. These findings suggest that at least in some contexts decision makers may equate risk and delay. Other explanations are possible, however, demonstrating that the interaction between risk and delay is complex and not easily understood. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes fac-tors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and infor-mativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either H 1 or H 0 , and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evi-dence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected prob-ability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},

abstract = {Discrete choice experiments-selecting the best and/or worst from a set of options-are increasingly used to provide more efficient and valid measurement of attitudes or preferences than conventional methods such as Likert scales. Discrete choice data have traditionally been analyzed with random utility models that have good measurement properties but provide limited insight into cognitive processes. We extend a well-established cognitive model, which has successfully explained both choices and response times for simple decision tasks, to complex, multi-attribute discrete choice data. The fits, and parameters, of the extended model for two sets of choice data (involving patient preferences for dermatology appointments, and consumer attitudes toward mobile phones) agree with those of standard choice models. The extended model also accounts for choice and response time data in a perceptual judgment task designed in a manner analogous to best-worst discrete choice experiments. We conclude that several research fields might benefit from discrete choice experiments, and that the particular accumulator-based models of decision making used in response time research can also provide process-level instantiations for random utility models.},

Although it is generally believed that people have stable tendencies toward being impulsive or patient, an emerging body of evidence indicates that intertemporal choice is malleable and can be profoundly influenced by context. How the choice is framed, or the state of the decision-maker at the time of choice, can induce a shift in preference. Framing effects are underpinned by allocation of attention to choice attributes, reference dependence, and time construal. Incidental affective states and prospection also influence intertemporal choice. We advocate that intertemporal choice models account for these context effects, and encourage the use of this knowledge to nudge people toward making more advantageous choices.},

Despite this consensus, however, authors routinely use these five elements in lieu of theory. We explain how each of these five elements can be confused with theory and how to avoid such confusion. By making this consensus explicit, we hope to help authors avoid some of the most common and easily averted problems that lead readers to view papers as having inadequate theory. We then discuss how journals might facilitate the publication of stronger theory. We suggest that if the field is serious about producing stronger theory, journals need to reconsider their empirical requirements. We argue that journals ought to be more receptive to papers that test part rather than all of a theory and use illustrative rather than definitive data.},

abstract = {A prevailing notion in experimental psychology is that individuals' performance in a task varies gradually in a continuous fashion. In a Stroop task, for example, the true average effect may be 50 ms with a standard deviation of say 30 ms. In this case, some individuals will have greater effects than 50 ms, some will have smaller, and some are forecasted to have negative effects in sign—they respond faster to incongruent items than to congruent ones! But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop or any other task? We highlight three qualitatively different effects: negative effects, null effects, and positive effects. The main goal of this paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there individuals with truly no effect? Are there any individuals with negative effects? We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below and above threshold for different people. We show that most tasks people are quite alike—for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails to Stroop or Stroops negatively. We also show a case that under very specific circumstances, we could entice some people to not Stroop at all.

Conceptualizing it as a socially distributed process opens up a variety of novel issues, which have been addressed in scattered literatures mostly outside of social psychology. This article examines some of these issues using a series of multiagent models. Perceivers can use gossip (information from others about social targets) to improve their ability to detect targets who perform rare negative behaviors. The model suggests that they can simultaneously protect themselves against being influenced by malicious gossip intended to defame specific targets. They can balance these potentially conflicting goals by using specific strategies including disregarding gossip that differs from a personally obtained impression. Multiagent modeling demonstrates the outcomes produced by different combinations of assumptions about gossip, and suggests directions for further research and theoretical development.},

abstract = {The present research is based on the assumption that people differ in their responsiveness to incentives and threats. In two experiments we examined whether the trait corresponding to the responsiveness to threats (avoidance motive) and the trait corresponding to the responsiveness to incentives (approach motive) influence voluntary motor behavior toward or away from stimuli. In Experiment 1, stimuli consisted of positive and negative words within a lexical decision task. Participants moved their arms backward in order to withdraw from the stimuli or forward in order to approach them. In Experiment 2, participants responded with forward or backward arm movements to neutral sounds coming from behind or in front of them. The main dependent variable was the strength of the approach and avoidance movements. In both experiments this variable was related to participants' avoidance-motive disposition but not to their approach-motive disposition. Avoidance-motivated individuals generally showed more forceful avoidance movements than approach movements. There was no effect of stimulus valence on the strength of the movements in Experiment 1. Furthermore, the results of Experiment 2 suggest that it is not the physical direction (forward or backward) but rather the movement's effect of distance reduction (approach) or distance increase (avoidance) in regard to the stimulus that defines a movement as an approach or an avoidance movement.},

abstract = {Humans are known to discount future rewards hyperbolically in time. Nevertheless, a formal recursive model of hyperbolic discounting has been elusive until recently, with the introduction of the hyperbolically discounted temporal difference (HDTD) model. Prior to that, models of learning (especially reinforcement learning) have relied on exponential discounting, which generally provides poorer fits to behavioral data. Recently, it has been shown that hyperbolic discounting can also be approximated by a summed distribution of exponentially discounted values, instantiated in the $\mu$Agents model. The HDTD model and the $\mu$Agents model differ in one key respect, namely how they treat sequences of rewards. The $\mu$Agents model is a particular implementation of a Parallel discounting model, which values sequences based on the summed value of the individual rewards whereas the HDTD model contains a non-linear interaction. To discriminate among these models, we observed how subjects discounted a sequence of three rewards, and then we tested how well each candidate model fit the subject data. The results show that the Parallel model generally provides a better fit to the human data.},

We applied this paradigm to recognition memory, manipulating task difficulty by changing the similarity of lures to targets. More difficult decision environments caused participants to make more careful decisions, but these changes did not appear immediately. We propose a simple theoretical account for these data, using a dynamic version of signal detection theory fitted to individual subjects.

TST asserts that threat avoidance is over-represented relative to other possible dream contents. To begin assessing this issue, we contrasted the incidence of 'avoidance' dreams with that of their opposite: 'approach' dreams. Because TST states that the threat-avoidance function is only fully activated in ecologically valid (biologically threatening) contexts, we also performed this contrast for populations living in both high- and low-threat environments. We find that 'approach' dreams are significantly more prevalent across both contexts. We suggest these results are more consistent with the view that dreaming is generated by reward-seeking systems than by fear-conditioning systems, although reward-seeking is clearly not the only factor determining the content of dreams.},

The method has the potential to provide powerful comparisons of complex and nonnested models that may also differ in terms of numbers of parameters. The generalization criterion differs from the better known cross-validation criterion in the following critical procedure. Although both employ a calibration stage to estimate parameters, cross-validation employs a replication sample from the same design for the validation stage, whereas generalization employs a new design for the critical stage. Two examples of the generalization criterion method are presented that demonstrate its usefulness for selecting a model based on sound scientific principles out of a set that also contains models lacking sound scientific principles that are either overly complex or oversimplified. The main advantage of the generalization criterion is its reliance on extrapolations to new conditions. After all, accurate a priori predictions to new conditions are the hallmark of a good scientific theory. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Research in shared mental models has immeasurably aided our understanding of effective teamwork and taskwork. However, little research has focused on the role that leaders play, if any, in influencing, developing and/or fostering shared mental models and thereby improving team performance. We developed an agent-based computational model based on McComb's theory of three-phase mental model development, where agents repeatedly share individual opinions (orientation phase), evaluate and respond to the opinions expressed by others (differentiation phase), and modify their understanding of the team based on the responses (integration phase). Leadership and team properties are represented in three experimental parameters: social network structure, heterogeneity of agents' domains of expertise, and level of their mutual interest. Participative leadership is represented by a fully connected network, while Leader-Member eXchange (LMX) is represented by a fully connected network of in-group members and several out-group members connected only to the leader. Our simulation results show that, in general, participative leadership promotes mental model convergence better than LMX. In the meantime, the team performance improvement is achieved by participative leadership only when members have both heterogeneous domains of expertise and strong mutual interest. In all other conditions, participative leadership causes the worst degradation of team performance through team development processes, while LMX is the best to minimize such team degradation. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Most people think climate change and sustainability are important problems, but too few global citizens engaged in high-greenhouse-gas-emitting behavior are engaged in enough mitigating behavior to stem the increasing flow of greenhouse gases and other environmental problems. Why is that? Structural barriers such as a climate-averse infrastructure are part of the answer, but psychological barriers also impede behavioral choices that would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. Although many individuals are engaged in some ameliorative action, most could do more, but they are hindered by seven categories of psychological barriers, or "dragons of inaction": limited cognition about the problem, ideological world views that tend to preclude pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, comparisons with key other people, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change. Structural barriers must be removed wherever possible, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. Psychologists must work with other scientists, technical experts, and policymakers to help citizens overcome these psychological barriers.},

This chapter outlines an emerging scientific agenda for understanding what these experiences feel like and how they arise. We review the available answers to what is felt (i.e., the content that makes up an experience of emotion) and how neurobiological processes instantiate these properties of experience. These answers are then integrated into a broad framework that describes, in psychological terms, how the experience of emotion emerges from more basic processes. We then discuss the role of such experiences in the economy of the mind and behavior.},

Two general varieties of theoretical models are considered: models in which the time-related change of primary interest is continuous, and those in which it is characterized by movement between discrete states. In addition, two general types of temporal designs are considered: the longitudinal panel design and the intensive longitudinal design. For each general category of theoretical models, some of the analytic possibilities available for longitudinal panel designs and for intensive longitudinal designs are discussed. The article concludes with brief discussions of two issues particularly relevant to longitudinal research--missing data and measurement--and a few words about exploratory research.},

The gambles in each pair were equated for expected value but differed in variance, amounts to win and lose and their respective probabilities. Information about each dimension could be obtained by the subject sequentially according to his preference. The results show that subjects are less risky under High as compared to Medium and Low time pressure, risk taking being measured by choices of gambles with lower variance or lower amounts to lose and win. Subjects tended to spend more time observing the negative dimensions (amount to lose and probability of losing), whereas under low time pressure they preffered observing their positive counterparts. Information preference was found to be related to choices. Filtration of information and acceleration of its processing appear to be the strategies of coping with time pressure.},

In such circumstances, accurate knowledge of the amount of time available for a decision is crucial for optimal choice behavior. However, the relation between temporal cognition and decision-making under time pressure is poorly understood. Here, we test how the precision of the internal representation of time affects choice behavior when decision time is limited by a deadline. We show that participants with a precise internal representation of time respond more cautiously in decision-making. Furthermore, we provide an empirical test of theoretical accounts of decision-making that argue that it is optimal to commit to a decision based on increasingly less evidence as the deadline approaches (so-called ‘collapsing decision bounds'). These theories entail that the speed of collapse of the decision bound should depend on the precision of the internal representation of the deadline. However, although we find evidence that participants collapse decision bounds, we found no relation between the amount of collapse and the internal representation of time.},

Yet, despite broad interest, no unifying, operational definition of cognitive effort itself has been proposed. Here, we argue that the most intuitive and epistemologically valuable treatment is in terms of effort-based decision-making, and advocate a neuroeconomics-focused research strategy. We first outline psychological and neuroscientific theories of cognitive effort. Then we describe the benefits of a neuroeconomic research strategy, highlighting how it affords greater inferential traction than do traditional markers of cognitive effort, including self-reports and physiologic markers of autonomic arousal. Finally, we sketch a future series of studies that can leverage the full potential of the neuroeconomic approach toward understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that give rise to phenomenal, subjective cognitive effort.},

abstract = {Decision theory distinguishes between risky prospects, where the probabilities associated with the possible outcomes are assumed to be known, and uncertain prospects, where these probabilities are not assumed to be known. Studies of choice between risky prospects have suggested a nonlinear transformation of the probability scale that overweights low probabilities and underweights moderate and high probabilities. The present article extends this notion from risk to uncertainty by invoking the principle of bounded subadditivity: An event has greater impact when it turns impossibility into possibility, or possibility into certainty, than when it merely makes a possibility more or less likely. A series of studies provides support for this principle in decision under both risk and uncertainty and shows that people are less sensitive to uncertainty than to risk. Finally, the article discusses the relationship between probability judgments and decision weights and distinguishes relative sensitivity from ambiguity aversion.},

abstract = {Models of decision making are distinguished by those that aim for an optimal solution in a world that is precisely specified by a set of assumptions (a so-called "small world") and those that aim for a simple but satisfactory solution in an uncertain world where the assumptions of optimization models may not be met (a so-called "large world"). Few connections have been drawn between these 2 families of models. In this study, the authors show how psychological concepts originating in the classic signal-detection theory (SDT), a small-world approach to decision making, can be used to understand the workings of a class of simple models known as fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs). Results indicate that (a) the setting of the subjective decision criterion in SDT corresponds directly to the choice of exit structure in an FFT; (b) the sensitivity of an FFT (measured in d') is reflected by the order of cues searched and the properties of cues in an FFT, including the mean and variance of cues' individual d's, the intercue correlation, and the number of cues; and (c) compared with the ideal and the optimal sequential sampling models in SDT and a majority model with an information search component, FFTs are extremely frugal (i.e., do not search for much cue information), highly robust, and well adapted to the payoff structure of a task. These findings demonstrate the potential of theory integration in understanding the common underlying psychological structures of apparently disparate theories of cognition.},

abstract = {Gardner and Altman explained the rationale for using estimation and confidence intervals in making inferences from analytical studies and described their calculation for means or proportions and their differences. ' In this paper we present methods for calculating confidence intervals for other common statistics obtained from medical investigations. The techniques for obtaining confidence intervals for estimates of relative risk are described. These can come either from an incidence study, where, for example, the frequency of a congenital malformation at birth is compared in two defined groups of mothers, or from a case-control study, where a group of patients with the disease of interest (the cases) is compared with another group of people without the disease (the controls). The methods of obtaining confidence intervals for standardised disease ratios and rates in studies of incidence, prevalence, and mortality are described. Such rates and ratios are commonly calculated to enable appropriate comparisons to be made between study groups after adjustment for confounding factors like age and sex. The most frequently used standardised indices are the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and the standardised mortality ratio (SMR). A worked example is included for each method. The calculations have been carried out to full arithmetical precision, as is recommended practice,2 although intermediate steps are shown as rounded results. Some of the methods given in this paper are large sample approximations and are not reliable for studies with fewer than about 20 cases. Appropriate design principles for these types of study have to be adhered to since confidence intervals convey only the effects of sampling variation on the precision of the estimated statistics and cannot control for other errors such as biases due to the selection of inappropriate controls or in the methods of collecting the data.},

abstract = {the history of structural equation modeling (SEM) can be roughly divided into two generations. The first generation of structural equation modeling began with the initial merging of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and simultaneous equation modeling (see, e.g., J{\"{o}}reskog, 1973). In addition to these founding concepts, the first generation of SEM witnessed important meth-odological developments in handling nonstandard con-ditions of the data. These developments included meth-ods for dealing with non-normal data, missing data, and sample size sensitivity problems (see, e.g., Kaplan, 2009). The second generation of SEM could be broadly characterized by another merger; this time, combining models for continuous latent variables developed in the first generation with models for categorical latent vari-ables (see Muth{\'{e}}n, 2001). The integration of continuous and categorical latent variables into a general modeling framework was due to the extension of finite mixture modeling to the SEM framework. This extension has provided an elegant theory, resulting in a marked in-crease in important applications. These applications in-clude, but are not limited to, methods for handling the evaluation of interventions with noncompliance (Jo {\&} Muth{\'{e}}n, 2001), discrete-time mixture survival models (Muth{\'{e}}n {\&} Masyn, 2005), and models for examining unique trajectories of growth in academic outcomes (Kaplan, 2003). A more comprehensive review of the history of SEM can be found in Matsueda (Chapter 2, this volume). A parallel development to first-and second-generation SEM has been the expansion of Bayesian methods for complex statistical models, including structural equa-tion models. Early papers include Lee (1981), Martin and McDonald (1975), and Scheines, Hoijtink, and Boomsma (1999). A recent book by Lee (2007) pro-vides an up-to-date review and extensions of Bayesian SEM. Most recently, B. Muth{\'{e}}n and Asparouhov (in press) demonstrate the wide range of modeling flex-ibility within Bayesian SEM. The increased use of Bayesian tools for statistical modeling has come about primarily as a result of progress in computational algo-rithms based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The MCMC algorithm is implemented in software programs such as WinBUGS (Lunn, Thomas, Best, {\&} Spiegelhalter, 2000), various packages within the R archive (R Development Core Team, 2008), and most recently Mplus (Muth{\'{e}}n {\&} Muth{\'{e}}n, 2010). The purpose of this chapter is to provide an accessi-ble introduction to Bayesian SEM as an important alter-native to conventional frequentist approaches to SEM. However, to fully realize the utility of the Bayesian ap-proach to SEM, it is necessary to demonstrate not only its applicability to first-generation SEM but also how Bayesian methodology can be applied to models char-c h a P t e r 3 8},

Current questions about AVs do not now revolve around whether such technologies should or should not be implemented; they are already with us. Rather, such questions are more and more focused on how such technologies will impact evolving transportation systems, our social world, and the individuals who live within it and whether such systems ought to be fully automated or remain under some form of direct human control. More importantly, how will mobility itself change as these independent operational vehicles first share and then dominate our roadways? How will the public be kept apprised of their evolving capacities, and what will be the impact of science and the communication of scientific advances across the varying forms of social media on these developments? We look here to address these issues and to provide some suggestions for the problems that are currently emerging. automated vehicles | future transportation infrastructure | trust in autonomy | public reactions | individuated technology},

abstract = {This paper reviews research on dynamic decision making, i.e., decision making under conditions which require a series of decisions, where the decisions are not independent, where the state of the world changes, both autonomously and as a consequence of the decision maker's actions, and where the decisions have to be made in real time. It is difficult to find useful normative theories for these kinds of decisions, and research thus has to focus on descriptive issues. A general approach, based on control theory, is proposed as a means to organize research in the area. An experimental paradigm for the study of dynamic decision making, that of computer simulated microworlds, is discussed, and two approaches using this paradigm are described: the individual differences approach, typical of German work in the tradition of research on complex problem solving, and the experimental approach. In studies following the former approach, the behaviour of groups differing in performance is compared, either with respect to strategies or with respect to performance on psychological tests. The results show that there are wide interindividual differences in performance, but no stable correlations between performance in microworlds and scores on traditional psychological tests have been found. Experimental research studying the effects of system characteristics, such as complexity and feedback delays, on dynamic decision making has shown that decision performance in dynamic tasks is strongly affected by feedback delays and whether or not the decisions have side effects. Although neither approach has led to any well-developed theory of dynamic decision making so far, the results nevertheless indicate that we are now able to produce highly reliable experimental results in the laboratory, results that agree with those found in field studies of dynamic decision making. This shows that an important first step towards a better understanding of these phenomena has been taken.},

abstract = {Work motivation is a topic of crucial importance to the success of organizations and societies and the well-being of individuals. We organize the work motivation literature over the last century using a meta-framework that clusters theories, findings, and advances in the field according to their primary focus on (a) motives, traits, and motivation orientations (content); (b) features of the job, work role, and broader environment (context); or (c) the mechanisms and processes involved in choice and striving (process). Our integrative review reveals major achievements in the field, including more precise mapping of the psychological inputs and operations involved in motivation and broadened conceptions of the work environment. Cross-cutting trends over the last century include the primacy of goals, the importance of goal striving processes, and a more nuanced conceptualization of work motivation as a dynamic, goal-directed, resource allocation process that unfolds over the related variables of time, experience, and place. Across the field, advances in methodology and measurement have improved the match between theory and research. Ten promising directions for future research are described and field experiments are suggested as a useful means of bridging the research–practice gap. Motivation related to work remains one of the most enduring and compelling topics in industrial/organizational (I/O) psychol-ogy. As part of the larger field of motivational science, motivation related to work examines fundamental questions about the influ-ence of nonability person attributes (e.g., motives, traits, goals), work ecologies, and the mechanisms and processes involved in purposive action. Work motivation affects the skills that individ-uals develop, the jobs and careers that individuals pursue, and the manner in which individuals allocate their resources (e.g., atten-tion, effort, time, and human and social capital) to affect the direction, intensity, and persistence of activities during work. At the same time, work motivation is a topic of critical importance to public policymakers and organizations concerned with developing work environments, human resource policies, and management practices that promote vocational adjustment, individual well-being, and organizational success. As such, work motivation stands at the nexus of society, science, and organizational success. The increasing importance of motivation over the last century is reflected in both the number and nature of motivation-related publications that have appeared in Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP). As shown in Figure 1, the number of these publications (as indexed by keyword count) has increased over the decades. How-ever, a more thorough perusal of these articles indicates that motivation (although always considered important) did not truly emerge as a major research topic in JAP until the mid-20th century, with the introduction of theories by Atkinson (1958), Bandura (1977), Carver and Scheier (1981), Deci (1975), Fishbein and Ajzen (1975), Hackman and Oldham (1975), Locke (1966), Vroom (1964), and others. As these research streams have ma-tured, motivation-related publications in JAP have focused on the role of individual differences (e.g., traits and motives), resource allocation and self-regulation processes, and the sociostructural context of work. As JAP celebrates its centennial, theory and research on work motivation stands at an important crossroad. Recent changes in the nature of work and the workforce have increased the need for new knowledge that can be used to cultivate and sustain work motivation. These trends, along with the avail-ability and increasing use of new methodologies to track work experiences, assess motives, and evaluate motivational processing across levels and over time suggest that the field is well-positioned (and overdue) for yet another round of innovation and growth. With these developments in mind, the purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to provide a meta-framework for organizing and understanding the work motivation literature as it has evolved over the last century, (2) to highlight major contributions and themes in different parts of the meta-framework (with an emphasis on works published in JAP), and (3) to identify major trends and promising future research directions. Motivation is frequently used as an umbrella term meant to capture the dense network of concepts and their interrelations that underlie observable changes in the initiation, direction, intensity, and persistence of voluntary action. As in other complex areas of human functioning, researchers have pursued different aspects of the phenomena in ways that have sometimes led to confusion in understanding, studying, and managing work motivation. We pro-pose a heuristic meta-framework (see Figure 2) that expands the often used process-content organization of relevant theories and motivation-related concepts into a tripartite organization: content, context, and process (Kanfer, Chen, {\&} Pritchard, 2008). We base this organization on the observation that motivation theory and research in JAP and related journals has been driven by three fundamental questions: (1) What desires, wants, and needs elicit action? This is the classic question of what features of the indi-vidual spurs action, and pertains to the role of needs, universal motives (e.g., mastery, autonomy), and trait-based preferences. (2) What role do environmental factors play in motivation? Most theories of motivation recognize that behavior is also influenced by its context. Recently, Johns (2006) has suggested a multilevel perspective in which discrete contextual variables, such as job-related characteristics, sociostructural variables, physical condi-tions, and work events are nested within broader omnibus contex-tual variables, such as occupation, culture, and economic conditions. Most theory-driven research in JAP has focused on proximal or discrete contextual variables. (3) Through what psy-chological processes and mechanisms do person and environment factors affect the direction, intensity, and persistence of action? Process-oriented research focuses on the " how " of motivation. That is, what are the cognitive and affective mechanisms and processes by which individuals integrate person and environmental inputs to form goals, plans, and intentions (goal choice), and regulate their affect, attention, effort, and behavior for the purpose of goal accomplishment (goal striving). Several process-oriented theories currently popular in work motivation provide an integra-tive conceptualization of the processes involved in goal choice and goal striving. Our organization of the field and major contributions follows from our systems approach, rather than adopting a strict historical perspective. As shown in Figure 2, within each section, theories, constructs, and research findings are clustered in terms of concep-tual communalities and differentiated in terms of when we noted each approach to appear most prominently in the work motivation literature (often years after a theory's introduction in the broader psychology literature). In the content segment, we highlight theo-ries and empirical findings on motives presumed fundamental for 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Mo va on Self-regula on},

abstract = {Bridge sampling is an effective Monte Carlo method for estimating the ratio of normalizing constants of two probability densities, a routine computational problem in statistics, physics, chemistry, etc. The Monte Carlo error of the bridge sampling estimator is determined by the amount of overlap between the two densities. Complementing and generalizing the Warp-I, II, and III transformations (Meng and Schilling, 2002), which are most effective for increas-ing the overlap between two uni-modal densities, we introduce Warp-U transformations that aim to transform multi-modal densities into Unimodal ones but without altering their normalizing constants. The construction of Warp-U transformation starts with a Gaussian (or other convenient) mixture distribution $\phi$mix that has a reasonable overlap with a target density p underlying the unknown normalizing constant. The stochastic transformation that maps $\phi$mix back to its generating distribution N (0, 1) is then applied to p, resulting in its Warp-U transformatio{\~{n}} p. The overlap betwee{\~{n}} p and N (0, 1) is theoretically guaranteed to be no less than the overlap between p and $\phi$mix, as measured by anyf -divergence, leading to statistically more efficient bridge sampling estimators. We propose a computationally efficient method to find an appropriate $\phi$mix, and use simulations to explore various esti-mation strategies and the choices of tuning parameters, with the aim to achieve statistical efficiency without unduly losing computational efficiency. We illustrate our findings using 10-50 dimensional highly irregular multi-modal densities. We also propose a strategy for using Warp-U transformations to improve MCMC algorithms, especially for sampling from multi-modal distributions.},

We recommend that future attempts to identify and estimate moderator effects should be limited to situations where better measures, stronger research designs and a realistic cost-benefit assessment are available. Researchers should avoid moderator hypotheses in contexts where the measures and research designs employed do not allow them to be tested in a meaningful way, and should be cautious about interpreting the very small effects they are likely to find.},

Therefore, people are more likely to adhere to their standards at the beginning and end of goal pursuit—and slack in the middle. We demonstrate this pattern of judgment and behavior in adherence to ethical standards (e.g., cheating), religious traditions (e.g., skipping religious rituals), and performance standards (e.g., " cutting corners " on a task). We also show that the motivation to adhere to standards by using proper means is independent and follows a different pattern from the motivation to reach the end state of goal pursuit.},

But even need-satisfying goals are pursued in the context of finite resources: How do we prioritize amongst multiple need-satisfying goals? Integrating self-determination theory with other needs theories, we proposed a baseline model whereby goals that are predominately relevant to relatedness would be prioritized over those predominately relevant to competence or autonomy. 202 participants completed a web survey about personal goals, including a goal sacrifice measure capturing within-person prioritization. Relatedness-predominant goals were prioritized over competence- and autonomy-predominant goals; this pattern was not accounted for by between-need differences in commitment and motivation regulation. People need autonomy, competence, and relatedness for optimal functioning, but in the face of limited resources they may prioritize goals that are predominately relevant to relatedness.},

abstract = {Cooperation is central to human social behaviour. However, choosing to cooperate requires individuals to incur a personal cost to benefit others. Here we explore the cognitive basis of cooperative decision-making in humans using a dual-process framework. We ask whether people are predisposed towards selfishness, behaving cooperatively only through active self-control; or whether they are intuitively cooperative, with reflection and prospective reasoning favouring 'rational' self-interest. To investigate this issue, we perform ten studies using economic games. We find that across a range of experimental designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally, an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection. To explain these results, we propose that cooperation is intuitive because cooperative heuristics are developed in daily life where cooperation is typically advantageous. We then validate predictions generated by this proposed mechanism. Our results provide convergent evidence that intuition supports cooperation in social dilemmas, and that reflection can undermine these cooperative impulses.},

We argue that the WLE is, in fact, undiagnostic for the decay hypothesis for two reasons. First, the WLE represents a correlation across words between articulation duration and memory performance, and articulation duration is inevitably confounded with other word characteristics. Recent research has confirmed that such confounds are responsible for much, maybe all, of the WLE. Second, there is strong evidence for an attentional mechanism of refreshing memory traces that can operate concurrently with articulation. Any viable decay-based model must include such a mechanism, but such a model no longer necessarily predicts a WLE, because longer spoken duration does not imply longer postponement of refreshing. We conclude that the WLE is not diagnostic for decay in short-term memory.},

Four decision theories are examined: rational models, bounded rationality, evidence accumulation, and parallel constraint satisfaction models. Although most theories were confirmed with regard to certain predictions, none of the theories adequately accounted for the role of attention during decision making. Several observations emerged concerning the drivers and down-stream effects of attention on choice, suggesting that attention processes plays an active role in constructing decisions. So far, decision theories have largely ignored the constructive role of attention by assuming that it is entirely determined by heuristics, or that it consists of stochastic information sampling. The empirical observations reveal that these assumptions are implausible, and that more accurate assumptions could have been made based on prior attention and eye movement research.

abstract = {To launch this Special Issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology celebrating the 1st century of the journal we conducted a review encompassing the background of the founding of the journal; a quantitative assessment of its evolution across the century; and an examination of trends examining article type, article length, authorship patterns, supplemental materials, and research support. The journal was founded in March of 1917 with hopeful optimism about the potential of psychology being applied to practical problems could enhance human happiness, well-being, and effectiveness. Our quantitative content assessment using both keyword frequencies and latent semantic analyses of raw content, in both bottom-up (corpus driven) and top-down modes (analyst driven), converged to document an evolution ranging from a broad and exploratory applied psychology to a more focused industrial psychology to an industrial and organizational psychology to an organizational psychology. With respect to other trends, during the first 4 decades 20 to 30{\%} of journal items were book reviews, which then abruptly ceased in the mid-1950s. Articles have grown increasingly longer over time. Author teams are increasingly larger, and sole authored articles are vanishingly small in frequency. The use of supplemental materials and articles reporting research support have surged dramatically in the most recent period. Across the various foci we examined, our review portrays the evolution of the journal as reflecting the development of a mature, focused, and cumulative scientific discipline addressing psychological science applied to work and organizations.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient " turnkey " samplers.},

abstract = {Cognitive control is a vital executive process that is involved in selecting, generating, and maintaining appropriate, goal-directed behaviour. One operation that draws heavily on this resource is the mapping of sensory information to appropriate motor responses (i.e., response selection). Recently, a transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) study demonstrated that the left posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (pLPFC) is casually involved in response selection and response selection training. Correlational brain imaging evidence has also implicated the superior medial frontal cortex (SMFC) in response selection, and there is causal evidence that this brain region is involved in the proactive modulation of response tendencies when occasional stopping is required (response inhibition). However, to date there is only limited causal evidence that implicates the SMFC in response selection. Here, we investigated the role of SMFC in response selection, response selection training (Experiment 1) and response selection when occasional response inhibition is anticipated (Experiments 2 and 3) by employing anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS. Cathodal stimulation of the SMFC modulated response selection by increasing reaction times in the context of proactive response inhibition. Our results suggest a context dependent role of the SMFC in response selection and hint that task set can influence the interaction between the brain and behaviour.},

abstract = {The sunk-cost fallacy—pursuing an inferior alternative merely because we have previously invested significant, but nonrecoverable, resources in it—represents a striking violation of rational decision making. Whereas theoretical accounts and empirical examinations of the sunk-cost effect have generally been based on the assumption that it is a purely intrapersonal phenomenon (i.e., solely driven by one's own past investments), the present research demonstrates that it is also an interpersonal effect (i.e., people will alter their choices in response to other people's past investments). Across eight experiments (N = 6,076) covering diverse scenarios, I documented sunk-cost effects when the costs are borne by someone other than the decision maker. Moreover, the interpersonal sunk-cost effect is not moderated by social closeness or whether other people observe their sunk costs being “honored.” These findings uncover a previously undocumented bias, reveal that the sunk-cost effect is a much broader phenomenon ...},

abstract = {This study examined factors that influence the dynamic pursuit of multiple goals over time. As hypothesized, goal-performance discrepancies were significantly related to subsequent time allocation. Greater distance from a given goal resulted in greater time subsequently allocated to that goal. In addition, the incentives offered for goal attainment determined the relative influence of discrepancies for each goal. When the incentives for each goal were equivalent, progress toward each goal exhibited equal influence, with greater time allocated to whichever goal was furthest from completion at the time. However, with an incentive available for only 1 of the 2 goals, time allocation was largely determined by progress toward the rewarded goal. Likewise, when incentives for each task differed in their approach-avoidance framing, progress toward the avoidance-framed goal was a stronger predictor of subsequent allocation than was progress toward the approach-framed goal. Finally, the influence of goal-performance discrepancies differed as a function of the time remaining for goal pursuit. The implications for future work on dynamic goal prioritization and the provision of performance incentives are discussed.},

The question asked in this work is whether a threat of disappearance changes the way people value such options. In four experiments using “door games,” we demonstrate that options that threaten to disappear cause decision makers to invest more effort and money in keeping these options open, even when the options themselves seem to be of little interest. This general tendency is shown to be resilient to information about the outcomes, to increased experience, and to the saliency of the cost. The last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying the tendency to keep doors open is a type of aversion to loss rather than a desire for flexibility.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that preferences among options in riskless choice are often influenced by reference points. That is, an existing reference level or status quo can bias preferences toward new alternatives. Reference-dependent effects have typically been attributed to loss aversion (Tversky {\&} Kahneman, 1991). The key idea is that when an option is being considered, an individual assesses the advantages and disadvantages of that option along each attribute with respect to the reference point. Disadvantages (losses) are weighted more than advantages (gains) in the decision process. This research provides new experimental evidence that 3 standard reference-dependent effects arise in a low-level perceptual decision task with nonhedonic stimuli. This casts doubt on explanations such as loss aversion, which are limited to high-level decisions with hedonic stimuli, and indicates that reference-dependent effects may be amenable to a general explanation at the level of the basic decision process.

abstract = {Two connectionist frameworks, GRAIN (J. L. McClelland, 1993) and brain-state-in-a-box (J. A. Anderson, 1991), and R. Ratcliff s (1978) diffusion model were evaluated using data from a signal detection task. Dependent variables included response probabilities, reaction times for correct and error responses, and shapes of reaction-time distributions. The diffusion model accounted for all aspects of the data, including error reaction times that had previously been a problem for all response-time models. The connectionist models accounted for many aspects of the data adequately, but each failed to a greater or lesser degree in important ways except for one model that was similar to the diffusion model. The findings advance the development of the diffusion model and show that the long tradition of reaction-time research and theory is a fertile domain for development and testing of connectionist assumptions about how decisions are generated over time. Research aimed at investigating how information is processed over time has had a long and influential history in psychology. In 1938 in his general textbook, Woodworm discussed simple and choice reaction time, the behaviors and shapes of reaction-time distributions, individual differences in reaction time, and the ef-fects on reaction time of experimental variables such as stimulus intensity. Several of these topics are raised again in this article. In the 1960s, when the cognitive revolution gave rise to modern cognitive psychology, reaction time entered the spotlight as a major dependent variable. Since then, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of theories to explain how information is processed over time to yield mean response times, distributions of response times, and accuracy levels. Current theoretical issues include, for example, serial versus parallel processes and contin-uous versus discrete processes, and efforts continue toward com-prehensive theories of the time course of processing. A summary of the state of reaction-time theory is presented in Luce (1986). Perhaps the main difficulty in recent modeling has been that two dependent variables, reaction time and the probability of correct versus error responses, have to be modeled in the same, integrated framework.},

abstract = {In the current study, we empirically examined the proposition that failure experiences (a) alter the nature of the relationship between self-efficacy and performance and (b) shape the trajectory of self-efficacy over time. Participants (N= 128 young adult males) were randomly assigned to an induced failure or a control condition where they completed five sessions of a complex computer-based performance task, each preceded by a measure of self-efficacy. Multiple group discontinuous latent growth modeling (MGLGM) and piecewise hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) were used to compare similarities and differences across conditions in the self-efficacy-performance relationship and in the trajectory of self-efficacy over time. The findings showed that self-efficacy decreased immediately following induced failure; an effect that endured in later performance sessions, even after typical performance levels had recovered. Within-person (i.e., intra-individual) self-efficacy was negatively related to performance in the control condition, yet was unrelated to performance in the failure condition. Furthermore, the self-efficacy-performance relationship was dynamic such that between-person (i.e., inter-individual) self-efficacy was positively related to the trajectory of performance following failure, even when controlling for the effects of prior performance and task-related experience. These results suggest that failure experiences can fundamentally alter the form and direction of the self-efficacy-performance relationship. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Major changes are underway in the field of perceptual decision-making. Single-neuron studies have given way to population recordings with identified cell types, traditional analyses have been extended to accommodate these large and diverse collections of neurons, and novel methods of neural disruption have provided insights about causal circuits. Further, the field has expanded to include multiple new species: rodents and invertebrates, for example, have been instrumental in demonstrating the importance of internal state on neural responses. Finally, a renewed interest in ethological stimuli prompted development of new behaviors, frequently analyzed by new, automated movement tracking methods. Taken together, these advances constitute a seismic shift in both our approach and understanding of how incoming sensory signals are used to guide decisions. The field of perceptual decision-making has recently been bolstered by major advances in experimental approach. Resulting theoretical and experimental insights reveal how the brain interprets sensory signals, combines them with internal brain states, and selects the best course of action.},

abstract = {Quantitative models for response time and accuracy are increasingly used as tools to draw conclusions about psychological processes. Here we investigate the extent to which these substantive conclusions depend on whether researchers use the Ratcliff diffusion model or the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model. Simulations show that the models agree on the effects of changes in the rate of information accumulation and changes in non-decision time, but that they disagree on the effects of changes in response caution. In fits to empirical data, however, the models tend to agree closely on the effects of an experimental manipulation of response caution. We discuss the implications of these conflicting results, concluding that real manipulations of caution map closely, but not perfectly to response caution in either model. Importantly, we conclude that inferences about psychological processes made from real data are unlikely to depend on the model that is used.},

abstract = {The 3 most often-used performance measures in the cognitive and decision sciences are choice, response or decision time, and confidence. We develop a random walk/diffusion theory-2-stage dynamic signal detection (2DSD) theory-that accounts for all 3 measures using a common underlying process. The model uses a drift diffusion process to account for choice and decision time. To estimate confidence, we assume that evidence continues to accumulate after the choice. Judges then interrupt the process to categorize the accumulated evidence into a confidence rating. The model explains all known interrelationships between the 3 indices of performance. Furthermore, the model also accounts for the distributions of each variable in both a perceptual and general knowledge task. The dynamic nature of the model also reveals the moderating effects of time pressure on the accuracy of choice and confidence. Finally, the model specifies the optimal solution for giving the fastest choice and confidence rating for a given level of choice and confidence accuracy. Judges are found to act in a manner consistent with the optimal solution when making confidence judgments.},

We discuss the view that suboptimal choices may result from the efficient coding of decision-relevant information, a strategy that allows expected inputs to be processed with higher gain than unexpected inputs. Efficient coding leads to 'robust' decisions that depart from optimality but maximise the information transmitted by a limited-capacity system in a rapidly-changing world. We review recent work showing that when perceptual environments are variable or volatile, perceptual decisions exhibit the same suboptimal context-dependence as economic choices, and we propose a general computational framework that accounts for findings across the two domains.},

abstract = {Sixty-four young women expected to perform an easy, moderately difficult, or extremely difficult memory task with the opportunity to earn a small incentive for good performance. Cardiovascular (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and subjective measures were taken immediately prior to task performance. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) responses and ratings of goal attrac-tiveness were nonmonotonically related to expected task difficulty, with the most pronounced SBP elevations and highest goal attractiveness in the moderately difficult task condition. Product-moment correlations among cardiovascular response measures revealed a strong positive association between systolic and diastolic pressure (but not heart rate) change in the easy condition, positive relationships among all measures in the moderately difficult condition, and no significant correlations in the ex-tremely difficult condition. Subjective measures of arousal were not affected by the task difficulty manipulation. Principal findings are discussed in terms of a theoretical model proposed by Brehm (1979) that states that motivation varies as a nonmonotonic function of the difficulty of goal attain-ment. Intercorrelations among cardiovascular response variables are considered in terms of their possible indication of the mechanisms underlying blood pressure changes associated with variations in motivation.},

abstract = {We compare how the same cognitive model completes a task within two alternative modifications to a cognitive architecture to represent sleep deprivation. One modification (ACT-R/F) has a module that uses a biomathematical model of the effects of sleep deprivation on performance to drive parameter changes in the architecture that impact behavior and performance. The second, new, modification (ACT-R/$\Phi$) represents the effects of sleep deprivation on physiological systems and has these systems modulate cognition. The model completes the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) within both ACT-R/$\Phi$ and ACT-R/F. We found that the two implementations produced similar response times (means) in simulated days one and two. However, the distribution of the response times across the two days of sleep deprivation varied between models. The ACT-R/$\Phi$ model shows a wider distribution in both days 1 and 2 due to an increased and modulating production utility noise that affects its ability to select the correct rules consistently. Though they represent sleep deprivation in different ways, and on different levels, both of these implementations lead us towards a more unified understanding of how sleep deprivation affects our bodies, how we think and behave over time, and how to represent these effects.},

This investigation examined whether affective reactions associated with future events are the mechanism through which desires influence likelihood judgments. In 4 studies, affective reactions were manipulated for initially neutral events. Compared with a neutral condition, events associated with positive reactions were judged as likely to occur, and events associated with negative reactions were judged as unlikely to occur. Desirability biases were reduced when participants could misattribute affective reactions to a source other than future events, and the relationship between affective reactions and judgments was influenced when approach and avoidance motivations were independently manipulated. Together, these findings demonstrate that positive and negative affective reactions to potential events cause the desirability bias in likelihood judgments and suggest that this effect occurs because of a tendency to approach positive possibilities and avoid negative possibilities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Motivational conflict is central to alcohol dependence, with patients reporting motivation to limit their drinking at the same time as urges to drink alcohol. In addition, dual process models of addiction emphasise the power of automatic cognitive processes, particularly automatic approach responses elicited by alcohol-related cues, as determinants of drinking behavior. We aimed to examine the strength of automatic and self-reported alcohol approach and avoidance tendencies among alcohol-dependent inpatients relative to matched controls.

METHODS: A total of 63 alcohol-dependent patients undergoing detoxification and 64 light-drinking controls completed a stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) task, which assesses the speed of categorization of alcohol-related pictures by making symbolic approach and avoidance movements. We also included modified versions of the SRC task to assess automatic motivational conflict, that is, strong approach and avoidance tendencies elicited simultaneously by alcohol-related cues.

RESULTS: There were no differences between alcohol-dependent patients and controls on the SRC task, although individual differences in the quantity of alcohol consumed before entering treatment were significantly positively correlated with the strength of approach (but not avoidance) tendencies elicited by alcohol-related cues. Automatic approach tendencies were also positively correlated with self-reported "approach" inclinations and negatively correlated with self-reported "avoidance" inclinations.

CONCLUSIONS: Although alcohol-dependent patients and matched controls did not differ on automatic approach and avoidance tendencies elicited by alcohol-related cues, individual differences in the quantity of alcohol consumed before entering treatment were associated with the strength of automatic approach tendencies elicited by alcohol cues.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: We studied the effects of sleep deprivation on executive functions using a task battery which included a modified Sternberg task, a probed recall task, and a phonemic verbal fluency task. These tasks were selected because they allow dissociation of some important executive processes from non-executive components of cognition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Subjects were randomized to a total sleep deprivation condition or a control condition. Performance on the executive functions task battery was assessed at baseline, after 51 h of total sleep deprivation (or no sleep deprivation in the control group), and following 2 nights of recovery sleep, at fixed time of day (11:00). Performance was also measured repeatedly throughout the experiment on a control task battery, for which the effects of total sleep deprivation had been documented in previously published studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Six consecutive days and nights in a controlled laboratory environment with continuous behavioral monitoring.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three healthy adults (age range 22-38 y; 11 women). Twelve subjects were randomized to the sleep deprivation condition; the others were controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Performance on the control task battery was considerably degraded during sleep deprivation. Overall performance on the modified Sternberg task also showed impairment during sleep deprivation, as compared to baseline and recovery and compared to controls. However, two dissociated components of executive functioning on this task--working memory scanning efficiency and resistance to proactive interference--were maintained at levels equivalent to baseline. On the probed recall task, resistance to proactive interference was also preserved. Executive aspects of performance on the phonemic verbal fluency task showed improvement during sleep deprivation, as did overall performance on this task.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Sleep deprivation affected distinct components of cognitive processing differentially. Dissociated non-executive components of cognition in executive functions tasks were degraded by sleep deprivation, as was control task performance. However, the executive functions of working memory scanning efficiency and resistance to proactive interference were not significantly affected by sleep deprivation, nor were dissociated executive processes of phonemic verbal fluency performance. These results challenge the prevailing view that executive functions are especially vulnerable to sleep loss. Our findings also question the idea that impairment due to sleep deprivation is generic to cognitive processes subserved by attention.},

abstract = {This chapter broadens the definition of product experience from definitions that view product experience as the interaction of a person and a product. In fact both experience and substantial research now show that product experience is the interaction of a person and a product in a particular context or situation. Contextual research has received far less attention than either product research or person research, probably because both of these classes of variables are the main foci of major stakeholders. The huge product industry is the main stakeholder for product research; the huge health industry is the main stakeholder for person research. Technologies that support product-oriented research and health-oriented research ensure that these technologies remain the foci of food research and development activities. Research clearly shows that the same product is experienced differently in different environments. This chapter reviews the evidence for this. However, one's own experience confirms this as well; occasionally in fancy restaurants one questions whether the great experience is the food itself or the ambiance. And on the other end of the spectrum, one wonders whether he or she could ever enjoy airline food or hospital food.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC An avoidance goal is an undesired state from which a person seeks to distance themselves. Though important for understanding behavior, avoidance goals have received less attention than approach goals. In this paper, we present a dynamic, formal model that provides a framework for describing and predicting the dynamics of avoidance goal regulation. We conduct a series of simulations to examine the dynamic pattern of behavior that emerges from the model when an avoidance goal is pursued in isolation and when an approach goal is also present. Two versions of the model were examined. In the first, the avoidance goal is regulated by a positive feedback loop. In the second, the avoidance goal is regulated by a negative feedback loop. We find that the positive feedback model produces a pattern of runaway behavior, even in a scenario where an approach goal is also present. By contrast, the negative feedback loop model produces a stable pattern of behavior that is more consistent with existing theory. The findings provide an important step toward theoretical parsimony by demonstrating that avoidance goal regulation, like approach goal regulation, can be understood using a negative feedback control system framework. We discuss new insights provided by this model and its potential to spark empirical research.},

abstract = {Develops a theory of memory retrieval and shows that it applies over a range of experimental paradigms. Access to memory traces is viewed in terms of a resonance metaphor. The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

abstract = {In this paper, we challenge the traditional understanding of organizational routines as creating inertia in organizations. We adapt Latour's distinction between ostensive and performative to build a theory that explains why routines are a source of change as well as stability. The ostensive aspect of a routine embodies what we typically think of as the structure. The performative aspect embodies the specific actions, by specific people, at specific times and places, that bring the routine to life. We argue that the ostensive aspect enables people to guide, account for, and refer to specific performances of a routine, and the performative aspect creates, maintains, and modifies the ostensive aspect of the routine. We argue that the relationship between ostensive and performative aspects of routines creates an on-going opportunity for variation, selection, and retention of new practices and patterns of action within routines and allows routines to generate a wide range of outcomes, from apparent stability t...},

abstract = {Models of intertemporal choice draw on three evaluation rules, which we compare in the restricted domain of choices between smaller sooner and larger later monetary outcomes. The hyperbolic discounting model proposes an alternative-based rule, in which options are evaluated separately. The interval discounting model proposes a hybrid rule, in which the outcomes are evaluated separately, but the delays to those outcomes are evaluated in comparison with one another. The tradeoff model proposes an attribute-based rule, in which both outcomes and delays are evaluated in comparison with one another: People consider both the intervals between the outcomes and the compensations received or paid over those intervals. We compare highly general parametric functional forms of these models by means of a Bayesian analysis, a method of analysis not previously used in intertemporal choice. We find that the hyperbolic discounting model is outperformed by the interval discounting model, which, in turn, is outperformed by the tradeoff model. Our cognitive modeling is among the first to offer quantitative evidence against the conventional view that people make intertemporal choices by discounting the value of future outcomes, and in favor of the view that they directly compare options along the time and outcome attributes.},

Discussions of impulsiveness in the literature of economics, sociology, social psychology, dynamic psychology and psychiatry, behavioral psychology, and "behavior therapy" are reviewed. 'Impulsiveness seems to be best accounted for by the hyberbolic curves that have been found to describe the decline in effectiveness of rewards as the rewards are delayed from the time of choice. Such curves predict a reliable change of choice between some alternative rewards as a function of time. This change of choice provides a rationale for the known kinds of impulse control and relates them to several hitherto perplexing phenomena: behavioral rigidity, time-out from positive reinforcement, willpower, self-reward, compulsive traits, projection, boredom, and the capacity of punishing stimuli to attract attention.},

Diary items assessed goal-directed activities and positive and negative affect (PA and NA). Results showed that higher FFFS and Promotion were consistently associated with higher NA and PA, respectively, and FFFS was also associated with avoidance of responsibilities. Higher Promotion predicted greater daily goal progress and tendencies to rate goals as more promotion- and prevention-focused. Relationships between daily goal-directed activities and both sadness and satisfaction were moderated by BIS-r. Inconsistent with our hypothesis, low BAS Reward Responsiveness predicted increased enthusiasm with greater goal progress. A trend in the data showed evidence of regulatory fit in daily activities predicted by both Promotion and Prevention.

These relationships, and others, are well-described by sequential sampling models that assume that evidence for a given alternative is collected over time in proportion to its subjective value, amplified by attention. Furthermore, findings from a number of studies support a causal effect of attention on choice. This research is mostly focused on two-alternative forced choice, though some work has confirmed these relationships in multi-attribute and multi-alternative choice. Finally, we discuss recent interest in understanding what drives attention during the choice process, with findings suggesting that attention is drawn to noisier and more salient stimuli in two-alternative choice, as well as higher-value options in multi-alternative choice.},

Behavioral evidence was provided across 3 studies supporting the contention that external motivation to respond without prejudice results in the intention to hide prejudice and that externally motivated people actively work to reduce detectable prejudice. In contrast, internal motivation gives rise to the intention to be free of prejudice, and internally motivated people actively work to eliminate any form of prejudice whether or not it would be apparent to others.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of increasing automation replanning rates on operator performance and workload when supervising a decentralized network of heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. BACKGROUND: Futuristic unmanned vehicles systems will invert the operator-to-vehicle ratio so that one operator can control multiple dissimilar vehicles connected through a decentralized network. Significant human-automation collaboration will be needed because of automation brittleness, but such collaboration could cause high workload. METHOD: Three increasing levels of replanning were tested on an existing multiple unmanned vehicle simulation environment that leverages decentralized algorithms for vehicle routing and task allocation in conjunction with human supervision. RESULTS: Rapid replanning can cause high operator workload, ultimately resulting in poorer overall system performance. Poor performance was associated with a lack of operator consensus for when to accept the automation's suggested prompts for new plan consideration as well as negative attitudes toward unmanned aerial vehicles in general. Participants with video game experience tended to collaborate more with the automation, which resulted in better performance. CONCLUSION: In decentralized unmanned vehicle networks, operators who ignore the automation's requests for new plan consideration and impose rapid replans both increase their own workload and reduce the ability of the vehicle network to operate at its maximum capacity. APPLICATION: These findings have implications for personnel selection and training for futuristic systems involving human collaboration with decentralized algorithms embedded in networks of autonomous systems.},

Consequently, little is known about the time-varying and progressive aspects of workplace inci-vility as suggested by both the referent literature and experience. Within the context of employee burnout and withdrawal, we developed a novel, dynamic mediated model of workplace incivility change and tested specific predictions about its time-sequential effects. Latent change score modeling of weekly survey data from 131 employees indicates that incivility change uniquely affects subsequent changes in burnout, which, in turn, lead to subsequent changes in turnover cognitions. We also explore whether this dynamic mediated effect varies across time and indi-viduals.},

We reanalyze Bem's data with a default Bayesian t test and show that the evidence for psi is weak to nonexistent. We argue that in order to convince a skeptical audience of a controversial claim, one needs to conduct strictly confirmatory studies and analyze the results with statistical tests that are conservative rather than liberal. We conclude that Bem's p values do not indicate evidence in favor of precognition; instead, they indicate that experimental psychologists need to change the way they conduct their experiments and analyze their data.},

We then compared the performance of a model that is fit to both choice types simultaneously, with the performance of separate models fit to the risky choice and inter-temporal choice data. We find, using Bayesian model comparison, that the majority of participants are best fit by a single model that incorporates both risky and inter-temporal choices. This result supports the assumption that risky choices and inter-temporal choices may be special cases of risky inter-temporal choice. Our results also suggest that, under the conditions of our experiment, interpretation of monetary value is very similar in risky choices and inter-temporal choices.},

The model assumes that perceptual choices and associated response times are the consequence of the accrual of evidence for the various response alternatives up to a certain predetermined threshold. In addition, accrual of evidence is influenced by temporal leakage of information and mutual inhibition between the accumulators. In this paper we provide an overview of fitting routines that may be used to identify the parameter values used for generating data under the LCA assumptions. We find that because (a) there is no closed-form solution to the likelihood function of the LCA model, and (b) there are strong trade-offs between accumulation rate, leakage, and inhibition, it is extremely difficult to faithfully recover the parameters of the LCA model. To minimize these problems, we recommend to use DE-MCMC sampling, collect very large amounts of data, and constrain the parameter space where possible.},

abstract = {Value-based choices are influenced both by risk in potential outcomes and by whether outcomes reflect potential gains or losses. These variables are held to be related in a specific fashion, manifest in risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses. Instead, we hypothesized that there are independent impacts of risk and loss on choice such that, depending on context, subjects can show either risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses or the exact opposite. We demonstrate this independence in a gambling task, by selectively reversing a loss-induced effect (causing more gambling for gains than losses and the reverse) while leaving risk aversion unaffected. Consistent with these dissociable behavioral impacts of risk and loss, fMRI data revealed dissociable neural correlates of these variables, with parietal cortex tracking risk and orbitofrontal cortex and striatum tracking loss. Based on our neural data, we hypothesized that risk and loss influence action selection through approach-avoidance mechanisms, a hypothesis supported in an experiment in which we show valence and risk-dependent reaction time effects in line with this putative mechanism. We suggest that in the choice process risk and loss can independently engage approach-avoidance mechanisms. This can provide a novel explanation for how risk influences action selection and explains both classically described choice behavior as well as behavioral patterns not predicted by existing theory.},

Role models are often suggested as a way of motivating individuals to set and achieve ambitious goals, especially for members of stigmatized groups in achievement settings. Yet, the literature on role models tends not to draw on the motivational literature to explain how role models may help role aspirants achieve these outcomes. In this paper, we introduce role aspirants and their motivational processes into an understanding of role modeling by drawing on expectancy-value theories of motivation to bring together the disparate literatures on role models to form a cohesive theoretical framework. We first integrate different definitions of role models into a new conceptualization where we propose that role models serve 3 distinct functions in which they influence goals and motivation: acting as behavioral models, representing the possible, and being inspirational. We then build a theoretical framework for understanding not only when, but also how, role models can effectively influence motivation and goals. This new theoretical framework, the Motivational Theory of Role Modeling, highlights ways in which the power of role models can be harnessed to increase role aspirants' motivation, reinforce their existing goals, and facilitate their adoption of new goals.},

@article{Akerstedt,
abstract = {This paper summarizes work to validate and develop further the homeostatic and circadian component of a quantitative (computerized) three-process model for predicting alertness/sleepiness in daily living. The model uses sleep data as input and contains circadian and homeostatic components (amount of prior wake and amount of prior sleep), which are summed to yield predicted alertness on a scale between I and 16. The present validation was carried out using regression analysis, with sleepiness-related electroencephalographic parameters (alpha power density) from field and laboratory studies as criteria. The results showed that variations in alpha-power density in truck drivers, train drivers and laboratory subjects could be predicted with considerable accuracy (r2 {\textgreater} 0.70) from the model, as could subjective alertness. Levels {\$},7 on the 16-point scale were defined as critically low alertness. The paper also describes a simplified, graphic, paper version of the computation model, visualized as a two-dimensional "alertness nomogram". It is suggested that the studied components of the model may serve as tools for evaluating work/rest schedules in terms of sleep-related safety risks. Key Words: Sleepiness-EEG-Alertness-Model-Circadian -Homeostasis. Sleepiness is a serious problem for individuals who have to displace sleep and/or work hours away from the conventional time. Severe subjective sleepiness and sleep-related electroencephalographic (EEG) changes characterize, for example, night-working truck drivers (1) and train drivers (2). In process operators, bouts of sleep actually occur during work (3). As may be ex-pected, sleepiness at work also leads to accidents, in-cluding major events such as nuclear disasters (4). In order to explain and predict variations in alertness related to irregular sleep/wake patterns, we have con-structed a quantitative model that uses sleep/wake tim-ing to predict alertness (5). The work was inspired by the two-process model of sleep regulation, which had shown that sleep length and slow-wave activity could be described by a combination of homeostatic (prior time awake or amount of prior sleep) and a circadian influence (6). Using subjective alertness data from a number of experiments of altered sleep/wake patterns, we found that alertness was also predictable from a},

abstract = {People prefer to receive good outcomes immediately rather than wait, and they must be compensated for waiting. But what influences their decision about how much compensation is required for a given wait? To give a partial answer to this question, we develop the DRIFT model, a heuristic description of how framing influences intertemporal choice. We describe 4 experiments showing the implications of this model. In the experiments, we vary how the difference between a smaller sooner outcome and a larger later outcome is framed-either as total interest earned, as an interest rate, or as total amount earned (the conventional frame in studies of intertemporal choice)-and whether the larger later outcome is described as resulting from the investment of the smaller sooner one. These alternate frames have several effects. First, the investment language increases patience. Second, the explicit provision of the (otherwise implicit) experimental interest rate sharply reduces the magnitude effect. Correspondingly, we find that interest frames increase patience when the rewards are small, but they decrease patience when they are large. Third, the interest-rate frame induces somewhat greater discounting for longer time periods and, thus, reverses the common finding of "hyperbolic" discounting. Thus, many of the "stylized facts" implied by studies involving choices between a smaller sooner and a larger later amount are eliminated or reverse under alternate outcome frames.},

A growing body of research has sought to use sleep to forecast cognitive performance by modeling the relationship between the two, but has generally focused on vigilance rather than other cognitive constructs affected by sleep, such as reaction time, executive function, and working memory. Previous modeling efforts have also utilized subjective, self-reported sleep durations and were restricted to laboratory environments. In the current effort, we addressed these limitations by employing wearable systems and mobile applications to gather objective sleep information, assess multi-construct cognitive performance, and model/predict changes to mental acuity. Thirty participants were recruited for participation in the study, which lasted 1 week. Using the Fitbit Charge HR and a mobile version of the automated neuropsychological assessment metric called CogGauge, we gathered a series of features and utilized the unified model of performance to predict mental acuity based on sleep records. Our results suggest that individuals poorly rate their sleep duration, supporting the need for objective sleep metrics to model circadian changes to mental acuity. Participant compliance in using the wearable throughout the week and responding to the CogGauge assessments was 80{\%}. Specific biases were identified in temporal metrics across mobile devices and operating systems and were excluded from the mental acuity metric development. Individualized prediction of mental acuity consistently outperformed group modeling. This effort indicates the feasibility of creating an individualized, mobile assessment and prediction of mental acuity, compatible with the majority of current mobile devices.},

The autoalert system benefited performance both in the automated task and mission completion task, whereas the autopilot system benefited performance in the automated task, the mission completion task, and the target search task. Practical implications for the study include the suggestion that reliable automation can help alleviate task interference and reduce workload, thereby allowing pilots to better handle concurrent tasks during single- and multiple-UAV flight control.},

abstract = {How do feelings influence the effort of entrepreneurs? To obtain data on this issue, the authors implemented experience sampling methodology in which 46 entrepreneurs used cell phones to provide reports on their affect, future temporal focus, and venture effort twice daily for 24 days. Drawing on the affect-as-information theory, the study found that entrepreneurs' negative affect directly predicts entrepreneurs' effort toward tasks that are required immediately. Results were consistent for within-day and next-day time lags. Extending the theory, the study found that positive affect predicts venture effort beyond what is immediately required and that this relationship is mediated by future temporal focus. The mediating effects were significant only for next-day outcomes. Implications of findings on the nature of the affect-effort relationship for different time lags are discussed.},

abstract = {Dissociations have served as a key source of evidence for theory development in experimental psychology. Claims about the existence of multiple distinct psychological processes or systems are often based on demonstrations that manipulations such as working memory load, mood or instructions have differential effects on task performance. For example, a manipulation may have a larger effect on performance in one task, and a smaller or no detectable effect in another, as identified by statistical models like analysis of variance. However, inferring distinct underlying processes based on such interaction effects can be misleading. Such an inference depends on the strong – and probably false – assumption that underlying psychological variables map linearly onto the observable dependent variables. Fortunately, state-trace analysis offers an alternative approach to test for multiple underlying variables, avoiding the linearity assumption. We apply state-trace analysis to databases of studies from reasoning and from category learning that have been cited as evidence for qualitatively distinct processes. We show that many of the dissociations thought to reflect the operation of distinct processes disappear against the stricter criteria of state-trace analysis. We argue that it is important for experiments to be designed with state-trace analysis in mind, and highlight the need for the development and more widespread use of similar techniques. This will lead to a more rigorous foundation for theoretical claims about distinct underlying psychological mechanisms.},

They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task.

The brain areas recruited in this integration have been well characterized for delay discounting. However only a few studies have investigated how effort costs are integrated into value signals to eventually determine choice. In contrast to previous studies that have evaluated fMRI signals related to physical effort, we used a task that focused on cognitive effort. Participants discounted the value of delayed and effortful rewards. The value of cognitively effortful rewards was represented in the anterior portion of the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the value of the chosen option was encoded in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and cerebellum. While most brain regions showed no significant dissociation between effort discounting and delay discounting, the ACC was significantly more activated in effort compared to delay discounting tasks. Finally, overlapping regions within the right orbitofrontal cortex and lateral temporal and parietal cortices encoded the value of the chosen option during both delay and effort discounting tasks. These results indicate that encoding of rewards discounted by cognitive effort and delay involves partially dissociable brain areas, but a common representation of chosen value is present in the orbitofrontal, temporal and parietal cortices.},

Traditionally, multitasking performance is measured for each individual task, utilising multiple performance metrics. Recently, the human operator informatic model (HOIM) has been developed as a quantitative model of human–machine interaction capable of measuring multitasking performance with a single metric. In this study, we investigated the performance effects of both a different number of tasks and five different task combinations while maintaining a constant level of overall difficulty. Results indicate that, at a constant difficulty level, neither number of tasks nor task combination significantly affects multitasking performance, indicating the reliability of input baud rate as a measure of system complexity. No task interaction effects were found among the different tasks.

abstract = {The first aim of this research is to compare computational models of multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice when attribute values are explicit. The choice predictions of utility (standard random utility {\&} weighted valuation), heuristic (elimination-by-aspects, lexicographic, {\&} maximum attribute value), and dynamic (multi-alternative decision field theory, MDFT, {\&} a version of the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulator, MLBA) models are contrasted on both preferential and risky choice data. Using both maximum likelihood and cross-validation fit measures on choice data, the utility and dynamic models are preferred over the heuristic models for risky choice, with a slight overall advantage for the MLBA for preferential choice. The response time predictions of these models (except the MDFT) are then tested. Although the MLBA accurately predicts response time distributions, it only weakly accounts for stimulus-level differences. The other models completely fail to account for stimulus-level differences. Process tracing measures, i.e., eye and mouse tracking, were also collected. None of the qualitative predictions of the models are completely supported by that data. These results suggest that the models may not appropriately represent the interaction of attention and preference formation. To overcome this potential shortcoming, the second aim of this research is to test preference-formation assumptions, independently of attention, by developing the models of attentional sampling (MAS) model family which incorporates the empirical gaze patterns into a sequential sampling framework. An MAS variant that includes attribute values, but only updates the currently viewed alternative and does not contrast values across alternatives, performs well in both experiments. Overall, the results support the dynamic models, but point to the need to incorporate a framework that more accurately reflects the relationship between attention and the preference-formation process.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in studying individual differences in choices that involve trading off reward amount and delay to delivery because such choices have been linked to involvement in risky behaviors, such as substance abuse. The most ubiquitous proposal in psychology is to model these choices assuming delayed rewards lose value following a hyperbolic function, which has one free parameter, named discounting rate. Consequently, a fundamental issue is the estimation of this parameter. The traditional approach estimates each individual's discounting rate separately, which discards individual differences during modeling and ignores the statistical structure of the population. The present work adopted a different approximation to parameter estimation: each individual's discounting rate is estimated considering the information provided by all subjects, using state-of-the-art Bayesian inference techniques. Our goal was to evaluate whether individual discounting rates come from one or more subpopulations, using Mazur's (1987) hyperbolic function. Twelve hundred eighty-four subjects answered the Intertemporal Choice Task developed by Kirby, Petry and Bickel (1999). The modeling techniques employed permitted the identification of subjects who produced random, careless responses, and who were discarded from further analysis. Results showed that one-mixture hierarchical distribution that uses the information provided by all subjects suffices to model individual differences in delay discounting, suggesting psychological variability resides along a continuum rather than in discrete clusters. This different approach to parameter estimation has the potential to contribute to the understanding and prediction of decision making in various real-world situations where immediacy is constantly in conflict with magnitude.},

abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Psychonomic Society, Inc. Contextual cuing refers to a response time (RT) benefit that occurs when observers search through displays that have been repeated over the course of an experiment. Although it is generally agreed that contextual cuing arises via an associative learning mechanism, there is uncertainty about the type(s) of process(es) that allow learning to influence RT. We contrast two leading accounts of the contextual cuing effect that differ in terms of the general process that is credited with producing the effect. The first, the expedited search account, attributes the cuing effect to an increase in the speed with which the target is acquired. The second, the decision threshold account, attributes the cuing effect to a reduction in the response threshold used by observers when making a subsequent decision about the target (e.g., judging its orientation). We use the diffusion model to contrast the quantitative predictions of these two accounts at the level of individual observers. Our use of the diffusion model allows us to also explore a novel decision-level locus of the cuing effect based on perceptual learning. This novel account attributes the RT benefit to a perceptual learning process that increases the quality of information used to drive the decision process. Our results reveal both individual differences in the process(es) involved in contextual cuing but also identify several striking regularities across observers. We find strong support for both the decision threshold account as well as the novel perceptual learning account. We find relatively weak support for the expedited search account.},

We propose the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA), a new dynamic model that provides a quantitative account of all 3 context effects. Our account applies not only to traditional paradigms involving choices among hedonic stimuli, but also to recent demonstrations of context effects with nonhedonic stimuli. Because of its computational tractability, the MLBA model is more easily applied than previous dynamic models. We show that the model also accounts for a range of other phenomena in multiattribute, multialternative choice, including time pressure effects, and that it makes a new prediction about the relationship between deliberation time and the magnitude of the similarity effect, which we confirm experimentally.},

abstract = {Every time we encounter a new object, action, or event, there is some chance that we will need to assign it to a novel category. We describe and evaluate a class of probabilistic models that detect when an object belongs to a category that has not previously been encountered. The models incorporate a prior distribution that is influenced by the distribution of previous objects among categories, and we present two experiments that demonstrate that people are also sensitive to this distributional information. Two additional exper-iments confirm that distributional information is combined with similarity when both sources of information are available. We compare our approach to previous models of unsupervised categorization and to several heuristic-based models, and find that a hierarchical Bayesian approach provides the best account of our data.},

Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena.},

abstract = {Compared with reward seeking, punishment avoidance learning is less clearly understood at both the computational and neurobiological levels. Here we demonstrate, using computational modelling and fMRI in humans, that learning option values in a relative-context-dependent-scale offers a simple computational solution for avoidance learning. The context (or state) value sets the reference point to which an outcome should be compared before updating the option value. Consequently, in contexts with an overall negative expected value, successful punishment avoidance acquires a positive value, thus reinforcing the response. As revealed by post-learning assessment of options values, contextual influences are enhanced when subjects are informed about the result of the forgone alternative (counterfactual information). This is mirrored at the neural level by a shift in negative outcome encoding from the anterior insula to the ventral striatum, suggesting that value contextualization also limits the need to mobilize an opponent punishment learning system.},

Five studies addressed these questions. The authors proposed and found that regulatory focus moderates retaliation against an unfairness-enacting authority: Promotion-focus participants were more likely to retaliate than prevention-focus participants. Promotion focus was associated with, and also heightened the accessibility of, the individual self. In turn, individual-self accessibility influenced retaliation. In fact, prevention-focus participants were as retaliatory as promotion-focus participants under conditions of high individual-self accessibility. Implications for the procedural fairness and regulatory focus literatures are discussed, and suggestions for future research are offered.},

abstract = {To enable safe and efficient operation of a large number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as envisioned in future commercial operations, a novel networked-based air traffic control paradigm is needed to provide for autonomous route optimization and cooperation to enable deconfliction. This system would need to ensure deconfliction from nearby manned and unmanned operations and would need the capability to respond to unexpected close-proximity aircraft, known as interlopers. This network-based control paradigm will require that operators be able to oversee a network of cooperative and autonomous UAVs capable of maneuvering at low altitudes. Such a network would need new algorithms and increased autonomy to best support cooperative deconfliction and high level supervisory control, and one that also allows operators the ability to both understand local and global behavior of a network of UAVs. To this end, we propose a paradigm-shifting multi-layer distributed air traffic control concept focused on low altitude, high density UAV operations. This new architecture would include a group of analysts that perform a global analysis of the UAV network at a strategic level and more tactical, local controllers manipulating the UAV network, who are advised by the analysts. The proposed operational support system would include methods for the automatic identification of issues within the network, as well as a method for the automatic distribution of effective tasks to the most suitable personnel. This architecture would be a combination of current air traffic control techniques as well as those troubleshooting techniques found in other domains like network and cloud computing management.

abstract = {Organizations are multilevel systems. This axiom-the foundation of organizational systems theory-is reflected in the earliest examples of organizational theory, including the Hawthorne Studies (Roethlisberger {\&} Dickson, 1939), Homans's theory of groups (1950), Lewin's field theory (1951), sociotechnical systems theory (Emery {\&} Trist, 1960), Likert's theory of organizational effectiveness (1961), Thompson's (1967) theory of organizational rationality, and Katz and Kahn's (1966) social organizational theory, to name but a few. Further, this axiom continues to provide a foundation for virtually all contemporary theories of organizational behavior. Yet, despite the historical tradition and contemporary relevance of organizational systems theory, its influence is merely metaphorical. The system is sliced into organization, group, and individual levels, each level the province of different disciplines, theories, and approaches. The organization may be an integrated system, but organizational science is not. There are signs that this is beginning to change, that we are moving toward the development of an integrated conceptual and methodological paradigm for organizational science. We have witnessed the evolution, over the last two decades, of multilevel frameworks that have well-developed conceptual foundations and associated analytic methodologies. Organizational science is moving toward the development of a paradigm that can bridge the micro-macro gap in theory and research. We are witnessing the maturation of the multilevel paradigm in organizational science.1},

The recent literature on emotion regulation (ER), however, highlights that humans typically make efforts to control emotion experiences. This leaves open the possibility that decision effects previously attributed to acute emotion may be a consequence of acute ER strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. In Study 1, we manipulated ER of laboratory-induced fear and disgust, and found that the cognitive reappraisal of these negative emotions promotes risky decisions (reduces risk aversion) in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and is associated with increased performance in the prehunch/hunch period of the Iowa Gambling Task. In Study 2, we found that naturally occurring negative emotions also increase risk aversion in Balloon Analogue Risk Task, but the incidental use of cognitive reappraisal of emotions impedes this effect. We offer evidence that the increased effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal in reducing the experience of emotions underlies its beneficial effects on decision making.},

abstract = {Research has indicated that regions of left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are involved in integrating the motivational and executive function processes related to, respectively, approach and avoidance goals. Given that sensitivity to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli is an important feature of conceptualizations of approach and avoidance motivation, it is possible that these regions of DLPFC are preferentially activated by valenced stimuli. The present study tested this hypothesis by using a task in which goal pursuit was threatened by distraction from valenced stimuli while functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected. The analyses examined whether the impact of trait approach and avoidance motivation on the neural processes associated with executive function differed depending on the valence or arousal level of the distractor stimuli. The present findings support the hypothesis that the regions of DLPFC under investigation are involved in integrating motivational and executive function processes, and they also indicate the involvement of a number of other brain areas in maintaining goal pursuit. However, DLPFC did not display differential sensitivity to valence.},

The discounting model of impulsiveness (Ainslie, 1975) implies that delay-discounting rates are positively correlated with impulsiveness.

The results lend external validity to the delay-discounting rate as a measure of impulsiveness, a characteristic associated with substance abuse.},

Algorithmic decision tools have shown the potential to outperform traditional heuristic approaches to allocating limited flight hours in field campaigns. The present study examines the utility of algorithmic decision tools in an application to the Atmospheric RadiationMeasurement (ARM) Small Particles in Cirrus (SPartICus) campaign, which sampled cirrus clouds over the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) site between January and June 2010. Probabilistic forecasts of suitable data collection conditions were generated using relative humidity forecasts from the Global Forecast System (GFS) and self-organizing maps. An optimization procedure based on dynamic programming was then used to generate day-ahead fly/no-fly decisions for research flights over the SGP site. The quality of flight decisions thus generated were compared with those made by the SPartICus science team. Results showed that the algorithmic decision tool would have delivered 11{\%} more optimal data while shortening the length of the campaign season by 29 days and reducing the per-day expenditure of investigator time on activities of forecasting and decision-making.},

Sequential sampling models provide a way of accounting for speed-accuracy trade-offs and response bias shifts. In this study, we test the validity of a sequential sampling model of conflict detection in a simulated air traffic control task by assessing whether two of its key parameters respond to experimental manipulations in a theoretically consistent way. Through experimental instructions, we manipulated participants' response bias and the relative speed or accuracy of their responses. The sequential sampling model was able to replicate the trends in the conflict responses as well as response time across all conditions. Consistent with our predictions, manipulating response bias was associated primarily with changes in the model's Criterion parameter, whereas manipulating speed-accuracy instructions was associated with changes in the Threshold parameter. The success of the model in replicating the human data suggests we can use the parameters of the model to gain an insight into the underlying response bias and speed-accuracy preferences common to dynamic decision-making tasks.},

Two studies tested how preferences for eager (promotion-oriented) versus vigilant (prevention-oriented) judgment strategies affected self-serving explanations for success or failure. Regardless of their performance, those preferring vigilant strategies selectively endorsed a few explanations above others, whereas those preferring eager strategies more evenly endorsed multiple explanations. Furthermore, although the explanations selected by those preferring vigilant strategies were indeed self-serving (emphasizing personal responsibility for success and external circumstances for failure), the more balanced endorsement of multiple explanations by those preferring eager strategies was associated with attenuated self-serving tendencies. Finally, those preferring eager strategies were also less self-serving in their generalization from explanations of current performance to predictions of future performance. The larger implications of these findings for the role of strategic preferences in judgment are discussed.},

In the present research, we propose that relationship of within-person changes in self-efficacy with subsequent changes in resource allocation and performance depends upon one's typical level of self-efficacy; that is, increases and decreases in self-efficacy have different implications for individuals that are generally highly efficacious than for individuals who are typically less efficacious. Moreover, we propose that these relationships further depend upon the difficulty of goal being pursued. Support for these arguments is found across two studies. These results provide support for self-efficacy's non-monotonic relationship with resource allocation, including our proposition that the nature of this non-monotonic relationship differs as a function of difficulty. These results also help further illuminate when and for whom self-efficacy is likely to increase or decrease resource allocation and performance. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Rouder2009,
abstract = {Advances in science often come from identifying invariances—those elements that stay constant when oth-ers change. Kepler, for example, described the motion of planets. From an Earth-bound vantage point, planets seem to have strange and variable orbits. Not only do they differ in their speeds and locations, they even appear to back-track at times (a phenomenon known as retrograde mo-tion). Although planetary orbits appear variable, Kepler identified invariants in planetary motion. For example, all orbits follow ellipses in which the square of the orbital pe-riod is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. These invariances formed the basis for Newton's subsequent the-ory of mechanics (Hawking, 2002). A similar story holds in genetics, where Mendel's discovery of invariant ratios in phenotypes served as an important precursor for the construction of genetic theory. Although the search for invariances has often motivated theory in other domains, it has not had as much impact in psychology. Invariances are statements of equality, sameness, or lack of association, whereas in practice, the psychological field has a Popperian orientation, in which demonstrations of effects or associations are valued more than demonstrations of invariances (Meehl, 1978). As a contrast, we offer below a few examples of how scientific inquiry in cognitive psychology has benefited from con-sideration of invariances: 1. It is often of great practical and theoretical interest to determine whether performance is invariant to readily ob-servable variables. For example, several researchers have assessed whether cognitive skills vary with gender (e.g., Shibley Hyde, 2005, 2007). To believe that only effects of genders, rather than invariances across genders, will appear in performance strikes us as an extreme position. A second example comes from the domain of subliminal priming (see, e.g., Dehaene et al., 1998): To prove that subliminal priming occurs, it must be shown that detection or identification of the primes does not vary from chance (see Reingold {\&} Merikle, 1988; Rouder, Morey, Speck-man, {\&} Pratte, 2007). 2. Conservation laws are instantiations of invariances. An example of a proposed conservation law is the Weber– Fechner law (Fechner, 1860/1966), which states that the detectability of a briefly flashed stimulus is a function of its intensity divided by the intensity of the background. Accordingly, performance should be invariant when the intensities of the flash and background are multiplied by the same constant. Another example of a proposed conser-vation law is the choice rule (Clarke, 1957; Luce, 1959; Shepard, 1957), which states that the preference for a choice is a function of the ratio of its utility divided by the summed utility of all available choices. The key in-variance here concerns ratios of preferences between any two choices—for example, the preference for Choice A divided by that for Choice B. This ratio should not vary when choices are added or taken away from the set of available options. 3. Testing invariances is critical for validating paramet-ric descriptions. Consider the example of Stevens (1957), who proposed that sensation follows a power function of intensity. It is reasonable to expect that the exponent of 225},

DESIGN: Participants' regulatory orientation was either measured (as a chronic trait) or manipulated (as a situational state), and participants were randomly assigned to implementation intention conditions to eat more healthy snacks or avoid eating unhealthy ones.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A self-reported online food diary of healthy and unhealthy snacks over a 2-day period.

RESULTS: Participants with weak unhealthy snacking habits consumed more healthy snacks when forming any type of implementation intentions (regardless of match or mismatch with their regulatory orientation), while participants with strong unhealthy snacking habits consumed more healthy snacks only when forming implementation intentions that matched their regulatory orientations.

CONCLUSION: RESULTS suggest that implementation intentions that match regulatory orientation heighten motivation intensity and put snacking under intentional control for people with strong unhealthy snacking habits.},

abstract = {Human decision-making almost always takes place under time pressure. When people are engaged in activities such as shopping, driving, or playing chess, they have to continually balance the demands for fast decisions against the demands for accurate decisions. In the cognitive sciences, this balance is thought to be modulated by a response threshold, the neural substrate of which is currently subject to speculation. In a speed decision-making experiment, we presented participants with cues that indicated different requirements for response speed. Application of a mathematical model for the behavioral data confirmed that cueing for speed lowered the response threshold. Functional neuroimaging showed that cueing for speed activates the striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), brain structures that are part of a closed-loop motor circuit involved in the preparation of voluntary action plans. Moreover, activation in the striatum is known to release the motor system from global inhibition, thereby facilitating faster but possibly premature actions. Finally, the data show that individual variation in the activation of striatum and pre-SMA is selectively associated with individual variation in the amplitude of the adjustments in the response threshold estimated by the mathematical model. These results demonstrate that when people have to make decisions under time pressure their striatum and pre-SMA show increased levels of activation.},

abstract = {Intertemporal choices involve trade-offs between the value of rewards and the delay before those rewards are experienced. Canonical intertemporal choice models such as hyperbolic discounting assume that reward amount and time until delivery are integrated within each option prior to comparison1,2. An alternative view posits that intertemporal choice reflects attribute-wise processes in which amount and time attributes are compared separately3–6. Here, we use multi-attribute drift diffusion modelling (DDM) to show that attribute-wise comparison represents the choice process better than option-wise comparison for intertemporal choice in a young adult population. We find that, while accumulation rates for amount and time information are uncorrelated, the difference between those rates predicts individual differences in patience. Moreover, patient individuals incorporate amount earlier than time into the decision process. Using eye tracking, we link these modelling results to attention, showing that patience results from a rapid, attribute-wise process that prioritizes amount over time information. Thus, we find converging evidence that distinct evaluation processes for amount and time determine intertemporal financial choices. Because intertemporal decisions in the lab have been linked to failures of patience ranging from insufficient saving to addiction7–13, understanding individual differences in the choice process is important for developing more effective interventions.},

Also, the EZ-diffusion model can be applied to common experimental setups in which each participant contributes only a moderate amount of data and error rate is low (i.e., 5{\%}–10{\%}). The outline of this article is as follows. The next sec-tion briefly discusses the methods of analysis that are cur-rently standard in the field. Then we briefly describe the " full " Ratcliff diffusion model and introduce the simpli-fied, " EZ " version. Subsequent sections detail the perfor-mance of the EZ method in terms of parameter recovery and robustness against misspecification. Then we use a real-world data set to compare parameter estimates for the EZ model against those for the Ratcliff diffusion model. We conclude by stressing the practicality of the present approach and by acknowledging the potential dangers of blindly applying the EZ model to situations in which its assumptions do not hold. The Standard Analysis of Two-Choice RT Tasks and Its Limitation For many decades, the analysis of data from two-choice RT tasks has remained unchanged. The standard analy-sis separately considers MRT and P c . Specifically, one ANOVA is performed for MRT and a second for P c . The standard analysis is simple but crude, and it can be im-proved in various ways. For instance, Rouder, Lu, Speck-man, Sun, and Jiang (2005) recently introduced a Bayes-ian hierarchical model of Weibull distributions that bases inference not just on MRT, but on the entire RT distribu-tion for correct decisions. Similar sophistications (e.g., hierarchical logistic regression) can be proposed for the analysis of P c . Regardless of the statistical sophistication that the stan-dard method may undergo, the general framework fails to address the core problem of the two-alternative RT task. This is the problem of how to combine response speed and accuracy in a single index that reflects subject ability or task difficulty. To highlight the limitations of the standard method of inference, consider the performance of our hypotheti-cal participants in a two-alternative RT task, as shown in Table 1. Assume that the imaginary experiment involves very many trials, so that measurement error is negli-gible. The standard analysis method is perfectly able to rank-order the participants according to either MRT (i.e.,},

Bayesian methods are an ideal framework for doing just this. Existing approx-imate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods however rely on often insufficient ''summary statistics''. Here, I present and analyze a highly efficient extension of the recently proposed (Turner and Seder-berg 2014) Probability Density Approximation (PDA) method, which circumvents this insufficiency. This method combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation with tools from non-parametric statistics to improve upon existing ABC methods. The primary contributions of this article are: (1) A more efficient implementation of this method that substantially improves computational performance is described. (2) Theoretical results describing the influence of methodological approximation errors on posterior es-timation are discussed. In particular, while this method is highly accurate, even small errors have a strong influence on model comparisons when using standard statistical approaches (such as deviance information criterion). (3) An augmentation of the standard PDA procedure, termed ''resampled PDA'', that reduces the negative influence of approximation errors on performance and accuracy, is presented. (4) A number of examples of varying complexity are presented along with supplementary code for their implementation.},

abstract = {The " Law of Practice " – a simple nonlinear function describing the relation-ship between mean response time (RT) and practice – has provided a practically and theoretically useful way of quantifying the speed-up that characterizes skill ac-quisition. Early work favored a power law, but this was shown to be an artifact of biases caused by averaging over participants who are individually better described by an exponential law. However, both power and exponential functions make the strong assumption that the speedup always proceeds at a steadily decreasing rate, even though there are sometimes clear exceptions. We propose a new law that can both accommodate an initial delay resulting in a slower-faster-slower rate of learning, with either power or exponential forms as limiting cases, and which can account for not only mean RT but also the effect of practice on the entire distribution of RT. We evaluate this proposal with data from a broad array of tasks using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which pools data across participants while minimizing averaging artifacts, and using inference procedures that take into account differences in flexi-bility among laws. In a clear majority of paradigms our results supported a delayed exponential law.},

Previous work has shown that accumulator models, such as the drift-diffusion model, can provide accurate descriptions of the psychometric data for binary value-based choices, and that the choice process is guided by visual attention. However, the computational processes used to make choices in more complicated situations involving three or more options are unknown. We propose a model of trinary value-based choice that generalizes what is known about binary choice, and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. We find that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of the relationship between choice, reaction time, and visual fixation data using the same parameters that were estimated in previous work on binary choice. Our findings suggest that the brain uses similar computational processes to make binary and trinary choices.},

abstract = {We examined how social anxiety is related to appraisals for various disinhibited behaviors and sought to identify potential subgroups of socially anxious people. College students completed trait measures and appraised disinhibited behaviors on their potential for threat, opportunity to satisfy curiosity, and ability to enhance social status. Three months later, participants were asked to report on their frequency of disinhibited behaviors since the initial assessment. People with greater social anxiety demonstrated frequent approach-avoidance conflicts - co-existing recognition of threats and rewards - about social interactions and disinhibited behaviors. Even when asked about the activity most likely to be avoided, participants with greater social anxiety evaluated these as having potential to satisfy curiosity and advance their social status. Three qualitatively different groups of people were identified based on social anxiety tendencies and approach-avoidance appraisal patterns. Groups differed on the degree of approach-avoidance conflicts, measures of psychological and social well-being, and frequency of social interactions and disinhibited behaviors. Moderately socially anxious people who were approach oriented reported the most difficulties. Results suggest that social anxiety is associated with tension between competing desires to avoid anxiety and explore. However, there appears to be important variability in the regulatory orientation, behavior, and well-being of socially anxious people. Conclusions about the nature of social anxiety may be compromised by not attending to existing differences in self-regulatory orientation and strategies.},

abstract = {ObjectiveWe explore whether the visual presentation of relative position vectors (RPVs) improves conflict detection in conditions representing some aspects of future airspace concepts. BackgroundTo help air traffic controllers manage increasing traffic, new tools and systems can automate more cognitively demanding processes, such as conflict detection. However, some studies reveal adverse effects of such tools, such as reduced situation awareness and increased workload. New displays are needed that help air traffic controllers handle increasing traffic loads. MethodA new display tool based on the display of RPVs, the Multi-Conflict Display (MCD), is evaluated in a series of simulated conflict detection tasks. The conflict detection performance of air traffic controllers with the MCD plus a conventional plan-view radar display is compared with their performance with a conventional plan-view radar display alone. ResultsPerformance with the MCD plus radar was better than with radar alone in complex scenarios requiring controllers to find all actual or potential conflicts, especially when the number of aircraft on the screen was large. However performance with radar alone was better for static scenarios in which conflicts for a target aircraft, or target pair of aircraft, were the focus. ConclusionComplementing the conventional plan-view display with an RPV display may help controllers detect conflicts more accurately with extremely high aircraft counts. ApplicationsWe provide an initial proof of concept that RPVs may be useful for supporting conflict detection in situations that are partially representative of conditions in which controllers will be working in the future.},

An integral part of the event was the involvement of military UAV operators from the U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army. The involvement of UAV operators in the workshops was valuable in linking developers and human factors researchers in the improvement of UAV systems and operations - a practice that is too often implemented only after a system is deployed and the problems are found. The experience of operators serves as a "user's account" of the issues and problems concerning the operation of UAVs. The fact that operators have had first hand experience in operating UAVs provides a unique perspective to the problem of identifying the most pressing human factors issues. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the perspectives of two UAV operators that helped to set the tone for the entire First Annual Human Factors of UAVs Workshop. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This was tested in a sample of staff in a UK hospital department, which included nurses, doctors, specialists and administrative staff. The study used a diary method in which participants recorded their reactions to over 1000 interpersonal interactions between coworkers across 15 work days. Multilevel analyses indicated that staff felt significantly more emotionally drained after witnessing unpleasant interactions compared to pleasant ones. This effect was mediated both by what the staff felt in response to what they witnessed and by the extent to which they controlled their feelings. Staff felt more emotionally drained when they took the perspective of the target to a greater extent and when they witnessed interactions directly (first-hand) rather than indirectly (hearsay). Witnesses appear to be vulnerable to emotional depletion because they experience an affective reaction and self-regulate their own emotional response to what they have seen or heard. This third-party effect on the witnesses of unpleasant interactions has the potential not only to have a negative effect on the individual but to pervade the organisation.},

Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham {\&} Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

Concepts of the first sort are identifiable by: the statement of the concept contains only words reducible to empirical laws; validity of the empirical law is both "necessary and sufficient for the 'correctness' of the statements about the concept"; and the "quantitative expression of the concept can be obtained without mediate inference by suitable groupings of terms in the quantitative empirical laws." But concepts of the second sort do not fulfill these 3 conditions. In the interest of clarity it is proposed that the phrase "intervening variable" be restricted to concepts of the first kind, and that the phrase "hypothetical construct" be used for those of the second kind. The only rule for proper intervening variables is that of convenience. But hypothetical constructs have a cognitive, factual reference in addition to the empirical data which constitute their support.},

abstract = {Objective To introduce and illustrate recent advances in statistical approaches to simultaneous modeling of multiple change processes. Methods Provide a general overview of how to use structural equations to simultaneously model multiple change processes and illustrate the use of a theoretical model of change to guide selection of an appropriate specification from competing alternatives. The selected latent change score model is then fit to data collected during an adolescent weight-control treatment trial. Results A latent change score model is built starting with the foundation of repeated-measures analysis of variance and illus-trated using graphical notation. Conclusions The assumptions behind using structural equations to model change are discussed as well as limitations of the approach. Practical guidance is provided on matching the statistical model to the theory underlying the observed change processes and the research ques-tion(s) being answered by the analyses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) provides a framework for flexibly modeling multiple change processes. Using structural equations, researchers can specify a model of change that closely matches their substantive theories of how processes change and influence each other across time. Structural equations have been used for some time to specify or define latent curve models, where the com-ponents of the change trajectory (e.g., intercept, slope, quadratic, etc.) are represented by latent (a.k.a., random) variables that allow these components to vary across indi-viduals. There are, however, many types of change models that can be specified using structural equations. The most common are latent growth curve (LGC) models (Curran, Obeidat, {\&} Losardo, 2010), but there are others, including latent change score (LCS) models (McArdle, 2009), autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) models (Bollen {\&} Curran, 2004), trait–state models for longitudinal data (Kenny {\&} Zautra, 2001), piecewise latent trajectory models (Flora, 2008), and cross-lagged autoregressive models (Little, Preacher, Selig, {\&} Card, 2007). Moreover, each of these specifications can be modified to better re-flect the investigators' theory about how the processes change over time. The increasing number of possible specifications allows researchers to tailor their statistical model to answer their particular research question, but deciding on an approach that will provide an appropriate test of the hypothesis can be daunting. There is not currently a ''one-size-fits-all'' model, and selecting the most appropri-ate specification depends on the research question and the nature of the processes being studied. Access to an increas-ing number of possible specifications also increases the danger of post hoc selection, where researchers explore mul-tiple statistical models and select the one that best sup-ports the stated hypotheses instead of the one that most accurately reflects the processes being studied.

Sleep latencies after the second and third nights of sleep restriction reached levels equivalent to those observed after acute sleep deprivation, whereas Karolinska Sleepiness Scale scores did not reach these levels. Lapse occurrence increased after the second day of sleep restriction and reached levels equivalent to those observed after acute sleep deprivation. A statistical model revealed that sleepiness and lapses did not progressively worsen across days of sleep restriction. Ten percent fastest reaction times (i.e., optimal alertness) were not affected by acute or chronic sleep deprivation. Recovery to baseline levels of alertness and performance occurred after 8-hr recovery night.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged study participants, sleep restriction induced a high increase in sleep propensity but adaptation to chronic sleep restriction occurred beyond day 3 of restriction. This sleepiness attenuation was underestimated by the participants. One recovery night restores daytime sleepiness and cognitive performance deficits induced by acute or chronic sleep deprivation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCITATION: Philip P; Sagaspe P; Prague M; Tassi P; Capelli A; Bioulac B; Commenges D; Taillard J.

abstract = {Countless decisions, from the trivial to the crucial, are made in complex social contexts while facing uncertain consequences. Yet a large portion of decision making research focuses on either the effects of social interaction or the effects of environmental uncertainty by examining strategic games against others or individual games against nature. Drawing a connection between these approaches, the authors extend a standard individual choice paradigm to include social interaction with 1 other person. In this paradigm, 2 competing decision makers repeatedly select among 2 options, each offering a particular probability of a fixed payoff. When both players choose the same, correct option, the payoff is evenly split; when they choose different options, the player choosing the correct option receives the full payoff. The addition of this social dimension gives players an opportunity to fully exploit an uncertain environment via cooperation: By consistently choosing opposite options, two players can exploit the uncertain environ-ment more effectively than a single player could. We present 2 experiments that manipulate environ-mental (Experiment 1) and social (Experiment 2) aspects of the paradigm. In Experiment 1, the outcome probabilities were either known or unknown to participants; in Experiment 2, participants' attention was drawn to individual or group gains by introducing either within-or between-group competition. Efficient cooperation did not emerge spontaneously in Experiment 1. Instead, most people probability maximized, mirroring the behavior observed in individual choice. By contrast, between-group competition in Experiment 2 facilitated efficient— but not always equitable— exploitation of uncertain environments. This work links the concepts of individual risky choice and strategic decision making under both environmental and social uncertainty.},

This finding has prompted the suggestion that humans possess an implicit mental state tracking system (implicit Theory of Mind, ToM) that exists alongside a system that allows the deliberate and explicit analysis of the mental states of others (explicit ToM). Here we evaluate the evidence for this hypothesis and assess the extent to which implicit and explicit ToM operations are distinct. We review evidence showing that adults can indeed engage in ToM processing even without being conscious of doing so. However, at the same time, there is evidence that explicit and implicit ToM operations share some functional features, including drawing on executive resources. Based on the available evidence, we propose that implicit and explicit ToM operations overlap and should only be considered partially distinct.},

During the past 5 years, Hfq-mediated control has been an area of increasing focus because the protein has been linked to the action of many versatile RNA-based regulators that use basepairing interactions to regulate the expression of target mRNAs. The recent findings that Hfq assists in bimolecular RNA–RNA interactions and is similar structurally and functionally to eukaryotic Sm proteins have further fuelled interest in this impor- tant post-transcriptional regulator.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t We develop a broad theoretical framework for modelling difficult perceptual information integration tasks under different decision rules. The framework allows us to compare coac-tive architectures, which combine information before it enters the decision process, with parallel architectures, where logical rules combine independent decisions made about each perceptual source. For both architectures we test the novel hypothesis that participants break the decision rules on some trials, making a response based on only one stimulus even though task instructions require them to consider both. Our models take account of not only the decisions made but also the distribution of the time that it takes to make them, providing an account of speed-accuracy tradeoffs and response biases occurring when one response is required more often than another. We also test a second novel hypothesis, that the nature of the decision rule changes the evidence on which choices are based. We apply the models to data from a perceptual integration task with near threshold stimuli under two different decision rules. The coactive architecture was clearly rejected in favor of logical-rules. The logical-rule models were shown to provide an accurate account of all aspects of the data, but only when they allow for response bias and the possibility for subjects to break those rules. We discuss how our framework can be applied more broadly, and its relationship to Townsend and Nozawa's (1995) Systems-Factorial Technology.},

abstract = {In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to reproducibility. For example, the Reproducibility Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top psychology journals found that only 39{\%} could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual differences (often termed "hidden moderators") between the original research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and consumers should be mindful of contextual factors that might influence a psychological process. We offer several guidelines for dealing with contextual sensitivity in reproducibility.},

When new data are observed, its goal relevance is measured as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between belief distributions before and after the observa-tion.

Although these models account for the original Allais paradoxes, 11 new paradoxes show where prospect theories lead to self-contradiction or systematic false predictions. The new findings are consistent with and, in several cases, were predicted in advance by simple "configural weight" models in which probability-consequence branches are weighted by a function that depends on branch probability and ranks of consequences on discrete branches. Although they have some similarities to later models called "rank-dependent utility," configural weight models do not satisfy coalescing, the assumption that branches leading to the same consequence can be combined by adding their probabilities. Nor do they satisfy cancellation, the "independence" assumption that branches common to both alternatives can be removed. The transfer of attention exchange model, with parameters estimated from previous data, correctly predicts results with all 11 new paradoxes. Apparently, people do not frame choices as prospects but, instead, as trees with branches.},

abstract = {Decision making is a vital component of human and animal behavior that involves selecting between alternative options and generating actions to implement the choices. Although decisions can be as simple as choosing a goal and then pursuing it, humans and animals usually have to make decisions in dynamic environments where the value and the availability of an option change unpredictably with time and previous actions. A predator chasing multiple prey exemplifies how goals can dynamically change and compete during ongoing actions. Classical psychological theories posit that decision making takes place within frontal areas and is a separate process from perception and action. However, recent findings argue for additional mechanisms and suggest the decisions between actions often emerge through a continuous competition within the same brain regions that plan and guide action execution. According to these findings, the sensorimotor system generates concurrent action-plans for competing goals and uses online information to bias the competition until a single goal is pursued. This information is diverse, relating to both the dynamic value of the goal and the cost of acting, creating a challenging problem in integrating information across these diverse variables in real time. We introduce a computational framework for dynamically integrating value information from disparate sources in decision tasks with competing actions. We evaluated the framework in a series of oculomotor and reaching decision tasks and found that it captures many features of choice/motor behavior, as well as its neural underpinnings that previously have eluded a common explanation.},

Participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while watching short video clips of threatening actions and performed either color or emotion judgments. Seeing threatening actions interfered with performance in both tasks. Amygdala activation reflected both stimulus and task conditions. In contrast, threat stimuli prompted a constant activity in a network underlying reflexive defensive behavior (periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, and premotor cortex). Threat stimuli also disrupted ongoing behavior and provoked motor conflict in prefrontal regions during both tasks. The present results are consistent with the view that emotions trigger adaptive action tendencies independently of task settings.},

We summarize results on the characteristics of performance time predictions, processes and strategies, the influence of task characteristics and contextual factors, and the relations between estimates and characteristics of the estimator. Although dependent on the type of study and the level of analysis, underestimation was more frequently reported than overestimation in studies from the engineering and management literature. However, this was not the case in studies from the psychology literature. Our summaries challenge earlier results regarding the effects of factors such as complexity/difficulty and experience. We also question the recurrent finding that small tasks are overestimated and large tasks are underestimated, as this to some extent can be a statistical artifact caused by random error. Several other influences on predictions are identified and discussed. These include various types of anchoring effects, performance and accuracy incentives, task decomposition, request formats, group estimation, revisions of initial ideal or incomplete estimates, level of abstraction, and superficial cues. We summarize similarities and differences between performance time predictions (e.g., number of work hours) and completion time predictions (e.g., delivery dates) because many studies fail to distinguish between these 2 types of predictions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues in time prediction research and implications for research and application.},

abstract = {The concept of attention is central to theorizing in learning as well as in working memory. However, research to date has yet to establish how attention as construed in one domain maps onto the other. We investigate two manifestations of attention in category- and cue-learning to examine whether they might provide common ground between learning and working memory. Experiment 1 examined blocking and highlighting effects in an associative learning paradigm, which are widely thought to be attentionally mediated. No relationship between attentional performance indicators and working memory capacity (WMC) was observed, despite the fact that WMC was strongly associated with overall learning performance. Experiment 2 used a knowledge restructuring paradigm, which is known to require recoordination of partial category knowledge using representational attention. We found that the extent to which people successfully recoordinated their knowledge was related to WMC. The results illustrate a link between WMC and representational-but not dimensional-attention in category learning.},

abstract = {Two paradigms are commonly used to examine risky choice based on experiential sampling. The feedback paradigm involves a large number of repeated, consequential choices with feedback about the chosen (partial feedback) or chosen and foregone (full feedback) payoffs. The sampling paradigm invites cost-free samples before a single consequential choice. Despite procedural differences, choices in both experience-based paradigms suggest underweighting of rare events relative to their objective probability. This contrasts with overweighting when choice options are described, thereby leading to a 'gap' between experience and description-based choice. Behavioural data and model-based analysis from an experiment comparing choices from description, sampling, and partial- and full-feedback paradigms replicated the 'gap', but also indicated significant differences between feedback and sampling paradigms. Our results suggest that mere sequential experience of outcomes is insufficient to produce reliable underweighting. We discuss when and why underweighting occurs, and implicate repeated, consequential choice as the critical factor.},

This presentation reviews the goal orientation literature and identifies numerous conceptual ambiguities, including definitional inconsistencies, dimensional inconsistencies, and inconsistencies in the conceptualization of stability.

Uncertainty is a measure of unexplained variation, and can be partly caused by measurement errors, and partly by our lack of understanding about cause and effect. But predictions of climate change, and approaches to its mitigation, do not only carry uncertainties in the magnitude of responses, they also entail significant natural variability in time and space3.4 . Importantly, this spatial and temporal variability will not shrink with scientific progress. Embracing the difference and clearly distinguishing between these two sources of variation is therefore critically important for science communication as well as for collective and policy action (see Fig. 1)},

Individual differences in subjective effort could present a major and pervasive confound in behavioral and neuroscience assessments, by conflating cognitive ability with cognitive motivation. Self-report cognitive effort scales have been developed, but objective measures are lacking. In this study, we use the behavioral economic approach of revealed preferences to quantify subjective effort. Specifically, we adapted a well-established discounting paradigm to measure the extent to which cognitive effort causes participants to discount monetary rewards. The resulting metrics are sensitive to both within-individual factors, including objective load and reward amount, and between-individual factors, including age and trait cognitive engagement. We further validate cognitive effort discounting by benchmarking it against well-established measures of delay discounting. The results highlight the promise and utility of behavioral economic tools for assessing trait and state influences on cognitive motivation.},

abstract = {Recent debates in the psychological literature have raised questions about what assumptions underpin Bayesian models of cognition, and what inferences they license about human cognition. In this paper we revisit this topic, arguing that there are two qualitatively different ways in which a Bayesian model could be constructed. If a Bayesian model is intended to license a claim about optimality then the priors and likelihoods in the model must be constrained by reference to some external criterion. A descriptive Bayesian model need not correspond to any claim that the underlying cognition is optimal or rational, and is used solely as a tool for instantiating a substantive psychological theory. We present three case studies in which these two perspectives lead to different computational models and license different conclusions about human cognition. We argue that the descriptive Bayesian approach is more useful overall, especially when combined with principled tools for model evaluation and model selection. More generally we argue for the importance of making a clear distinction between the two perspectives. Considerable confusion results when descriptive models and optimal models are conflated, and if Bayesians are to avoid contributing to this confusion it is important to avoid making normative claims when none are intended.},

It has been implicated in a diversity of functions, from reward processing and performance monitoring to the execution of control and action selection. Here, we propose that this diversity can be understood in terms of a single underlying function: allocation of control based on an evaluation of the expected value of control (EVC). We present a normative model of EVC that integrates three critical factors: the expected payoff from a controlled process, the amount of control that must be invested to achieve that payoff, and the cost in terms of cognitive effort. We propose that dACC integrates this information, using it to determine whether, where and how much control to allocate. We then consider how the EVC model can explain the diverse array of findings concerning dACC function},

This paper introduces a Bayesian model selection approach that formalizes Occam's razor, choosing the simplest model that describes the data well. The choice of a model is carried out by taking into account not only the traditional model selection criteria (i.e., a model's fit to the data and the number of parameters) but also the extension ofthe parameter space, and, most importantly, the functional form of the model (i.e., the way in which the parameters are combined in the model's equation). An advantage of the approach is that it can be applied to the comparison of non-nested models as well as nested ones. Application examples are presented and implications of the results for evaluating models of cognition are discussed. A goal of research in psychology, as in other behavioral sciences, is to infer the underlying process that generated observed data. The use of sophisticated mathematical models to describe these processes has grown considerably, especially in cognitive psychology (see, e.g. Yet, the development of equally sophisticated and well-justified methods for evaluating the adequacy of the mod-els themselves has lagged behind.

@article{Laurence2005,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many accidents and incidents on mine sites have a causal factor in the rules and regulations that supposedly are in place to prevent the incident from occurring. The causes involve a lack of awareness or understanding, ignorance, or deliberate violations. The issue of mine rules, procedures, and regulations is a central focus of this paper, highlighted by this recent comment - "very few people have accidents for which there is no procedure in place..." METHOD: An attitudinal survey was conducted at 33 mines throughout NSW, Queensland and international mine sites involving almost 500 mineworkers. The survey was in the form of a self-completing questionnaire, consisting of approximately 65 questions. It aimed to seek the opinions of the mining workforce on safety rules and regulations generally, as well as how they apply to their specific jobs on a mine site. The research also aimed to investigate: (a) the level of awareness and understanding of mine rules and procedures such as manager's rules and safe work procedures (SWPs); (b) the level of awareness and understanding of mine safety regulations and legislation; (c) the extent of communication of and commitment to rules and regulations; (d) the extent of compliance with rules and regulations; and (e) attitudes regarding errors, risk-taking, and accidents and their interaction with rules and regulations. The sample consisted of a random selection of underground and open pit mines, extracting coal, metals, or industrial minerals. RESULTS: The insights provided by the mineworkers enabled a set of principles to be developed to guide mine management and regulators in the development of more effective rules and regulations. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPACT ON THE MINING INDUSTRY: (a) Management and regulators should not continue to produce more and more rules and regulations to cover every aspect of mining. (b) Detailed prescriptive regulations, detailed safe work procedures, and voluminous safety management plans will not "connect" with a miner. (c) Achieving more effective rules and regulations is not the only answer to a safer workplace.},

@article{Forstmeier2017,
abstract = {Recently there has been a growing concern that many published research findings do not hold up in attempts to replicate them. We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of ‘you can publish if you found a significant effect'. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of ‘you can publish if your study is rigorous'. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one's own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of ‘impact' almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.},

Although conflict was invoked in psychological approaches to decision making early on (Lewin, 1931/1964), no generally accepted measure of conflict strength has been established (Tversky {\&} Shafir, 1992). The present study introduces a model (multiattribute decision field theory) that predicts a decision time pattern depending on the conflict situation. In a risky decision-making experiment with multiattribute choice alternatives, decision time is investigated as a possible measure of conflict strength. It is shown that the model can be fitted to a complex choice pattern.},

abstract = {The controversial idea that information can be processed and evaluated unconsciously to change behavior has had a particularly impactful history. Here, we extend a simple model of conscious decision-making to explain both conscious and unconscious accu-mulation of decisional evidence. Using a novel dichoptic suppression paradigm to titrate conscious and unconscious evidence, we show that unconscious information can be accumulated over time and integrated with conscious elements presented either before or after to boost or diminish decision accuracy. The unconscious information could only be used when some conscious decision-relevant informa-tion was also present. These data are fit well by a simple diffusion model in which the rate and variability of evidence accumulation is reduced but not eliminated by the removal of conscious awareness. Surprisingly, the unconscious boost in accuracy was not accompa-nied by corresponding increases in confidence, suggesting that we have poor metacognition for unconscious decisional evidence. conscious awareness | decision-making | metacognition | continuous flash suppression | binocular rivalry O ne of the fundamental challenges to understanding and pre-dicting human behavior is that we are nonrational and often do not act in our own best interest. Indeed, many thinkers have struggled to conceptualize and model illogical and unexpected behavioral choices. One compelling proposition is that unconscious information can push and pull everyday decisions—without our explicit knowledge or permission. However, despite their popu-larity, such propositions lack strong experimental support. Research exploring the role of unconscious information pro-cessing in the context of decision-making has typically focused on the role of deliberation in the absence of conscious attention di-rected at a problem. Within this framework, inattentional thought has been argued to be superior to focused attentional deliberation when making complex decisions (1–4) because of the proposed larger information processing capacity of unconscious thought (5). However, these findings have faced much controversy, because several studies have failed to find evidence for inattentional de-liberation (6–10). A particularly important criticism here is that the tasks typically used do not allow for the adequate control of decision variables and hence, have little traction in assessing deliberation without attention. Moreover, these studies do not directly manipulate conscious awareness. Consequently, it is dif-ficult to determine whether any unconscious decisional processes actually occur during the period of inattention. Here, we developed a task in which we can control the amount of decision-relevant information available during both conscious and nonconscious processing. This task allowed us to investigate the idea that unconscious information can predictably alter con-scious decisions. We used a simple perceptual decision paradigm, which has produced many neurobiological and computational insights into decision-making in humans and nonhuman animals (reviewed in ref. 11). Cross-species behavioral and neural data support simple accumulation models, according to which a con-scious decision is made after enough noisy evidence has accu-mulated to a particular criterion level (12–15). These models can explain a variety of different behaviors, such as the relationship between accuracy, difficulty, and response time and even changes of mind (16). However, it is unknown if these models can account for unconscious decisional evidence that might affect behavior.},

We consider possible individual differences in MDS representations, using the recently proposed K-INDSCAL model, which allows for both sub-groups of people with different representations, and individual differences in the attention people give to different stimulus dimensions. We develop a novel Bayesian implementation of the K-INDSCAL model, and demonstrate in a simulation study it is capable of inferring meaningful individual differences for the sorts of data sets typically available in psychology. We then apply the model to three existing data sets, involving the taste of colas, images of cats, and colors of different hues. Collectively, the results demonstrate the flexibility of the K-INDSCAL model in finding both group- and individual-level differences, and highlight the need for Bayesian methods to make these inferences.},

abstract = {Are choices for others riskier than choices people make for themselves? This question has been asked by economists, psychologists, and other researchers in the social sciences – which has generated a diversity of research accounts and results. For example, a number of studies have found strong instances of a risky shift in choices for others, while other studies have found no such effect or have found that choices for others instead generate a cautious shift. In a meta-analysis of 128 effects from 71 published and unpublished papers (totaling 14,443 observations), we found a significant though small effect size (d = 0.105) in favor of a risky shift when people choose for others. Moreover, we found considerable variance between studies (Q = 1106.25), suggesting that the net effect is susceptible to moderating factors or study characteristics, which we identify and discuss as well (viz. choice recipient, decision frame, decision reciprocity, theoretical perspective, study design). Thus, we document not only whether decisions for others are riskier, but when (and when such decisions are less risky). We further discuss what is distinctly unique about decision making for others – how such choices are not just different in degree from personal choices but different in kind.},

Momentary differences between psychological values for the stimulus and the referent are accumulated over time until one or the other of two response thresholds is first exceeded. The theory is analyzed as a random walk bounded between two absorbing barriers. A general solution to response conditioned expected response times is computed and the important role played by the moment generating function (mgf) for increments to the random walk is examined. From considerations of the mgf it is shown that unlike other random walk models [Stone, 1960; Laming, 1968] the present theory does not imply that response conditioned mean correct and error times must be equal. For two fixed stimuli and a fixed referent it is shown that by controlling values of response thresholds, subjects can produce Receiver Operating Characteristics similar or identical to those predicted by Signal Detection Theory, High Threshold Theory, or Low Threshold Theory.},

Although there was substantial model mimicry, empirical conditions were identified under which the models make discrim-inably different predictions. The best accounts of the data were provided by the Wiener diffusion model, the OU model with small-to-moderate decay, and the accumulator model with long-tailed (exponential) distributions of criteria, although the last was unable to produce error RTs shorter than correct RTs. The relationship between these models and 3 recent, neurally inspired models was also examined.},

These emergent groups demonstrated in-group cooperation and out-group defection, even though agents lacked common identity. Group formation increased individual payoffs, and group number and size were robust to varying levels of reciprocity and transitivity. Increasing population size increased group size more than group number, and manipulating baseline trust in a population had predictable effects on group genesis.

These modules place chunks in buffers where they can be detected by a production system that responds to patterns of information in the buffers. At any point in time, a single production rule is selected to respond to the current pattern. Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the selection of rules to fire as well as the internal operations of some modules. Much of learning involves tuning of these subsymbolic processes.

The subjective pleasure/pain properties of a value target influence strength of engagement, but factors separate from the hedonic properties of the value target also influence engagement strength and thus contribute to the experience of attraction or repulsion. These additional sources of engagement strength include opposition to interfering forces, overcoming personal resistance, using the right or proper means of goal pursuit, and regulatory fit between the orientation and manner of goal pursuit.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

abstract = {This paper tests whether the dimensions involved in preferential choice tasks are evaluated independently from one another. Common decision heuristics satisfy dimensional independence, and multi-strategy models that assume that decision makers use a repertoire of these heuristics predict that they are unable to represent and respond to dimensional dependencies in the decision environment. In contrast, some single-strategy models are able to violate dimensional independence, and subsequently adapt to environments that feature interacting dimensions. Across five experiments, this paper documents systematic violations of the assumption of dimensional independence. This suggests that decision makers are able to modify their behavior to respond to dimensional dependencies in their environment, and in turn those models that are unable to do this do not provide a full account of human strategy selection and behavior change. This paper ends with a discussion of ways in which some existing models can be modified to incorporate violations of dimensional independence.

Four experiments found support for this claim. In Experiments 1a and 1b, emotional negativity was reduced for participants who placed a written recollection of a regretted past decision or unsatisfied strong desire inside an envelope. However, enclosing a stimulus unrelated to the emotional experience did not have the same effect (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, we showed that the effect was not driven by participants simply doing something extra with the materials, and that the effect of physical enclosure was mediated by the psychological closure that participants felt toward the event.},

abstract = {Early research in the field of intuitive physics provided extensive evidence that humans succumb to common misconceptions and biases when predicting, judging, and explaining activity in the physical world. Recent work has demonstrated that, across a diverse range of situations, some biases can be explained by the application of normative physical principles to noisy perceptual inputs. However, it remains unclear how knowledge of physical principles is learned, represented, and applied to novel situations. In this review we discuss theoretical advances from heuristic models to knowledge-based, probabilistic simulation models, as well as recent deep-learning models. We also consider how recent work may be reconciled with earlier findings that favored heuristic models. Reinvigorating Intuitive Physics Humans are able to understand their physical environment and interact with objects and substances that undergo dynamic state changes, making at least approximate predictions about how observed events will unfold (e.g., predicting the trajectory of a thrown ball, the direction that a chopped tree will fall, or the path of a breaking wave). The knowledge underlying such activities is termed intuitive physics (see Glossary). This topic, an active research area for several decades, has recently been reinvigorated by new theoretical approaches linked to artificial intelligence. These theories have been used to model findings from behavioral studies that apply psychophysical measures to perception and reasoning with complex dynamic displays. Here, we review recent research and theories (placing them in the context of earlier work), and discuss some of the ongoing controversies in the field.},

In line with the appellate court's ruling in that case, participants selected the character who first captured and possessed an animal as its owner over another character who had pursued it earlier. Together, these findings provide evidence for an assumption that specifically guides our reasoning about ownership and that may lead everyday intuitions about property to be generally consistent with property law.},

MADD is based on information processing models developed by Diederich. It belongs to the class of sequential comparison models and generalizes and extends the so-called decision field theory (DFT) of Busemeyer and Townsend. Describing the decision maker's choice behavior for multiattribute choice alternatives in an uncertain environment by a stochastic process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, MADD predicts choice probabilities and mean choice response times when the decision maker has to respond within a given time limit.

abstract = {a simplified version of the diffusion model that is able to uniquely determine these three important unobserved vari-ables from just three observed quantities: MRT, P c , and the variance of response times for correct decisions (VRT). Our mathematical analysis will show that VRT is much more informative with respect to subject ability or task difficulty than is MRT, echoing recent empirical insights in the aging literature An important practical advantage of the EZ-diffusion model is that it does not require a parameter fitting routine (cf. signal detection theory). Also, the EZ-diffusion model can be applied to common experimental setups in which each participant contributes only a moderate amount of data and error rate is low (i.e., 5{\%}–10{\%}). The outline of this article is as follows. The next sec-tion briefly discusses the methods of analysis that are cur-rently standard in the field. Then we briefly describe the " full " Ratcliff diffusion model and introduce the simpli-fied, " EZ " version. Subsequent sections detail the perfor-mance of the EZ method in terms of parameter recovery and robustness against misspecification. Then we use a real-world data set to compare parameter estimates for the EZ model against those for the Ratcliff diffusion model. We conclude by stressing the practicality of the present approach and by acknowledging the potential dangers of blindly applying the EZ model to situations in which its assumptions do not hold. The Standard Analysis of Two-Choice RT Tasks and Its Limitation For many decades, the analysis of data from two-choice RT tasks has remained unchanged. The standard analy-sis separately considers MRT and P c . Specifically, one ANOVA is performed for MRT and a second for P c . The standard analysis is simple but crude, and it can be im-proved in various ways. For instance, Rouder, Lu, Speck-man, Sun, and Jiang (2005) recently introduced a Bayes-ian hierarchical model of Weibull distributions that bases inference not just on MRT, but on the entire RT distribu-tion for correct decisions. Similar sophistications (e.g., hierarchical logistic regression) can be proposed for the analysis of P c . Regardless of the statistical sophistication that the stan-dard method may undergo, the general framework fails to address the core problem of the two-alternative RT task. This is the problem of how to combine response speed and accuracy in a single index that reflects subject ability or task difficulty. To highlight the limitations of the standard method of inference, consider the performance of our hypotheti-cal participants in a two-alternative RT task, as shown in Table 1. Assume that the imaginary experiment involves very many trials, so that measurement error is negli-gible. The standard analysis method is perfectly able to rank-order the participants according to either MRT (i.e.,},

This research explores when these individual goal pursuits can turn into competitions, why it happens, and the downstream consequences of this pseudocompetition on goal pursuers. We found that people were more likely to treat their goal pursuit as a competition when they were near the end (vs. at the beginning) of their individual goal and, thus, prioritized relative positional gain (i.e., performing better than others sharing similar pursuits) over making objective progress on their own goal, sabotaging others when they had the opportunity to do so (Studies 1-3B). Further, we provided evidence that certainty of goal attainment at a high (vs. low) level of progress drove this shift in focus, leading to such sabotage behaviors (Studies 3A and 3B). Ironically, success in gaining an upper hand against others in these pseudocompetitions led individuals to subsequently reduce their effort in their own pursuits (Studies 1-5). Six experiments captured a variety of competitive behaviors across different goal domains (e.g., selecting games that diminished others' prospects, selecting difficult questions for fellow students).

abstract = {By definition, dynamic decision making dictates that multiple and interrelated decisions be made in a continuously changing environment. Such decision making is difficult and often taxes individuals' cognitive resources. Here I investigated ways in which to support decision making in these environments. I evaluated three forms of decision support: outcome feedback, cognitive feedback, and feedforward that incorporated (to varying degrees) common features of learning theories associated with dynamic tasks. Participants in a laboratory experiment performed a real-time, dynamic decision-making task while receiving one of the different types of decision support. During the first 2 days, individuals received one type of decision support, but on the third day they performed the task without this support. Participants who received feedforward improved their performance considerably and continued to exhibit improved performance even after discontinuation of the decision support on the third day. Neither outcome feedback nor cognitive feedback resulted in improved performance. More research is necessary to conclusively identify the best forms of dynamic decision-making support and their durability when transferred to new tasks. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Human performance models are abstractions, usually mathematical or computational, that attempt to explain or predict human behavior in a particular domain or task. This includes a wide range of techniques and approaches, from ideas that are most likely familiar to the majority of human factors professionals (such as signal detection theory) to more novel and complex approaches (such as computational models of dual tasking while driving). This chapter provides a sampling of modeling approaches and domains to which those approaches have been applied; for a more in-depth review, see Pew and Mavor (1998). We also discuss some of the issues faced by modelers as well as describe some of the rich history of the mod-eling endeavor over the past 50 years. Science is built up of facts, as a house is built of stones; but an accumulation of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house. —Henri Poincar{\'{e}} Thi s chapter is intended for human factors researchers and practitioners who are inter-ested in modeling but are not experts in any particular modeling approach or domain. It should also be relevant to those who are already modelers and are interested in a survey of other domains and approaches in which human performance modeling (HPM) meth-ods have been applied. In addition, this chapter will provide some sense of the history of HPM as well. Although the Human Performance Modeling Technical Group has existed within the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society for only a few years, human factors profession-als have been constructing and applying models of human performance for at least as long as the half century that the society has existed. Paul Fitts's first publication of his model of aimed motor movement was in 1954; this was around the time that Hick (1952) and Hyman (1953) first published their models for choice reaction time; the seminal Swets (1964) volume on signal detection theory came not long after those works. These mod-els had not only tremendous impact but also longevity, as all of these formalisms are still in active use today. Not all models and modeling formalisms have been as successful as these have, but it is clear that models of human performance have had a substantial impact on human factors research and practice. 225},

Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is re- quired to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models.

abstract = {Quality of goal engagement and alternative goal suppression were investigated in this research. Integrating the dualistic model of passion (Vallerand et al., 2003) with goal-systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002), we hypothesized that obsessive passion-associated with recurrent goal-conflicts-would predict greater alternative goal suppression (i.e., goal-shielding) than would harmonious passion-characterized by effective synthesis of the passionate activity with other life domains. Results from 5 laboratory studies supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, participants' dispositional measures of harmonious and obsessive passion were correlated with an implicit measure of goal-shielding. Obsessive (but not harmonious) passion predicted the suppression of alternative goals and the progressive inhibition of unfamiliar goals. In Study 2, we extended these findings by demonstrating the interrelation between quality of goal engagement and goal-commitment such that goal-shielding effects were enhanced, but only for goals in conflict with other life domains (vs. well-integrated goals). In Study 3, the causal influence of passion on goal-shielding was supported via an experimental manipulation of passion. In Study 4, we replicated and extended Studies 1 and 3 by experimentally demonstrating that obsessive (but not harmonious) passion is a mindset conducive to the development of inhibitory links with alternative goals. Study 5 explored the psychological costs associated with repeated unconscious goal suppression by examining its effects on the depletion of self-regulatory resources. Collectively, the present results suggest that the qualitative distinction between obsessive and harmonious passion has implications for the goal-shielding effect and for subsequent self-regulatory behavior.},

abstract = {Choice reaction time (RT) experiments are an invaluable tool in psychology and neuroscience. A common assumption is that the total choice response time is the sum of a decision and a nondecision part (time spent on perceptual and motor processes). While the decision part is typically modeled very carefully (commonly with diffusion models), a simple and ad hoc distribution (mostly uniform) is assumed for the nondecision component. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the misspecification of the nondecision time can severely distort the decision model parameter estimates. In this article, we propose an alternative approach to the estimation of choice RT models that elegantly bypasses the specification of the nondecision time distribution by means of an unconventional convolution of data and decision model distributions (hence called the D*M approach). Once the decision model parameters have been estimated, it is possible to compute a nonparametric estimate of the nondecision time distribution. The technique is tested on simulated data, and is shown to systematically remove traditional estimation bias related to misspecified nondecision time, even for a relatively small number of observations. The shape of the actual underlying nondecision time distribution can also be recovered. Next, the D*M approach is applied to a selection of existing diffusion model application articles. For all of these studies, substantial quantitative differences with the original analyses are found. For one study, these differences radically alter its final conclusions, underlining the importance of our approach. Additionally, we find that strongly right skewed nondecision time distributions are not at all uncommon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {In the current study, extending from the cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) in Cole and Maxwell (2003), we proposed the multilevel autoregressive mediation models (MAMMs) by allowing the coefficients to differ across individuals. In addition, Level-2 covariates can be included to explain the interindividual differences of mediation effects. Given the complexity of the proposed models, Bayesian estimation was used. Both a CLPM and an unconditional MAMM were fitted to daily diary data. The 2 models yielded different statistical conclusions regarding the average mediation effect. A simulation study was conducted to examine the estimation accuracy of Bayesian estimation for MAMMs and consequences of model mis-specifications. Factors considered included the sample size (N), number of time points (T), fixed indirect and direct effect sizes, and Level-2 variances and covariances. Results indicated that the fixed effect estimates for the indirect effect components (a and b) and the fixed effects of Level-2 covariates were accurate when N Ն 50 and T Ն 5. For estimating Level-2 variances and covariances, they were accurate provided a sufficiently large N and T (e.g., N Ն 500 and T Ն 50). Estimates of the average mediation effect were generally accurate when N Ն 100 and T Ն 10, or N Ն 50 and T Ն 20. Furthermore, we found that when Level-2 variances were zero, MAMMs yielded valid inferences about the fixed effects, whereas when random effects existed, CLPMs had low coverage rates for fixed effects. DIC can be used for model selection. Limitations and future directions were discussed. Translational Abstract We propose the multilevel autoregressive mediation models (MAMMs) for longitudinal mediation analysis by allowing mediation effects to differ across individuals while accounting for the temporal sequence in the data. Person-level variables can be included to explain interindividual differences in mediation effects. Given the complexity of the proposed MAMMs, Bayesian estimation is used. A real data analysis revealed that inferences about the average mediation effect differed using an existing longitudinal mediation model assuming the same mediation effect across individuals and MAMMs. A simulation study was conducted to examine whether and when Bayesian estimation for MAMMs had accurate estimates and inferences of model parameters, and consequences of model mis-specifications. Results showed that when the number of indi-viduals (N) was greater than or equal to 50, and the number of time points (T) was greater than or equal to 5, the average mediation effect components (a and b) and direct effect (c) were accurately estimated and inferred. The same conclusion held for estimating and inferring the effects of person-level variables. Estimates of the average mediation effect were generally accurate when N Ն 100 and T Ն 10, or N Ն 50 and T Ն 20. Furthermore, ignoring interindividual differences in mediation effects may result in misleading inferences of a, b, c, and/or the average mediation effect. In contrast, assuming heterogeneous mediation effects across individuals whereas they did not exist in reality had minimal influences on inferences of a, b, c, and the average mediation effect. Limitations and future directions are discussed.},

Pre- and post-message measures of quit intention, attitude toward smoking cessation, and perceived behavioral control were taken in two separate waves from current cigarette smokers with varying levels of nicotine dependence (N=151). In the second wave, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the first group, participants read a smoking cessation message which emphasized the benefits of quitting (positive frame). In the second group participants read a message which emphasized the costs of not quitting (negative frame). Results show that smokers' intentions to quit smoking and their level of nicotine dependence jointly influence the persuasiveness of positive and negative message frames. When nicotine dependence and quitting intention are both high, a negative frame works best. Conversely, a positive frame is preferable when nicotine dependence or quitting intention is low. Smokers' level of processing is proposed as the underlying mechanism explaining the different effects of message frames.},

Next, maritime aircraft missions and required capabilities are outlined, and current practices for both manned and unmanned aircraft are described. Technological trends relating to UAS are also discussed, focusing on developments relevant to maritime UAS operations. This information provides a background for assessing potential future maritime UAS operations. Trends including miniaturization of sensors and computer systems, high energy density of power sources, and increased subsystem standardization and modularity will have important effects in the future. However, another significant trend is towards increased system autonomy via new command and control frameworks that facilitate integration of UAS into higher level maritime observing systems through new concepts of operation for networked systems and new business models.},

The 9-repeat allele of the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene, associated with increased striatal dopamine levels, has been found to be related to increased sensitivity to reward. However, it remains unexplored whether this polymorphism influences automatic action tendencies in the social domain. We set out to test experimentally whether human carriers of the 9-repeat allele show increased approach-avoidance tendencies compared to non-9-repeat carriers. One hundred and one healthy adults, genotyped for the DAT gene, performed the social Approach-Avoidance Task, a reaction time task requiring participants to approach or avoid visually presented emotional (happy and angry) faces, by pulling a joystick towards them or pushing the joystick away from themselves, respectively. In accordance with expectations, 9-repeat carriers showed stronger approach-avoidance effects compared to non-9-repeat carriers. These results suggest a role for striatal dopaminergic polymorphisms in motivational responses to social-emotional cues. Our findings may be relevant in the selection of candidate genes in future studies involving social behavior.},

The second is the period through World War II, in which we see the roots of modern methodological concepts and techniques, including a transition from a discovery orientation to a hypotheticodeductive model orientation. The third takes us through roughly 1970, a period in which many of our modern-day practices were formed, such as reliance on null hypothesis significance testing. The fourth, from 1970 through 1989, sees an emphasis on the development of measures of critical constructs. The fifth takes us into the present, which is marked by greater plurality regarding data-analytic approaches. Finally, we offer a glimpse of possible and, from our perspective, desirable futures regarding research methods.

abstract = {Human behavior can be organized around two fundamental motivational principles: the desire to approach positive outcomes and the desire to avoid negative outcomes. Both approach and avoidance motivation are relevant to a range of psychopathology, including depression. However, with some notable exceptions, avoidance processes have been underemphasized in the literature on motivational processes in depression. This review will examine the roles that approach and avoidance play in depression and will present an integrative model of approach and avoidance processes in depression. Both approach deficits and avoidance motivation are argued to play a role in limiting positive experiences and reinforcement for non-depressed behavior, contributing to the onset and maintenance of depression. In addition, avoidance processes are argued to play a role in negative information processing biases that may increase vulnerability to the onset and recurrence of depression. Lastly, avoidance processes and dysregulation in the connections between the approach and avoidance systems may contribute to depression by promoting inappropriate perseveration in the pursuit of unattainable approach goals. Theoretical rationales and empirical evidence for each of these roles are presented. Understanding the roles that both approach and avoidance play in depression may help to inform current conceptualizations of depression and improve treatment outcomes.},

The increasing complexity introduced by the recent move towards network centric operations (NCO) in U.S. military operations provides additional challenges for efficient decision-making. Future operations will include co-located and distributed teams composed of operators from difference services, often at different global locations. Military operations which require extremely quick decisions, such as operations dealing with time-sensitive targets (TST) like improvised explosive devices (IEDs), are particularly challenging in NCO teaming environments. Operators in TST environments not only have to manage overwhelming amounts of target-related information, but also have the overhead of communicating and coordinating with co-located and distributed team members. Given the increasing trend for modern hostile forces to employ unconventional weapons such as IEDs and suicide bombs, the success of TST operations are becoming critical to current and future military operations. Providing TST teams with effective tools for communicating and coordinating their efforts is key to enabling their success.},

abstract = {According to a common conception in behavioral decision research, two cognitive processes-overestimation and overweighting-operate to increase the impact of rare events on people's choices. Supportive findings stem primarily from investigations in which people learn about options via descriptions thereof. Recently, a number of researchers have begun to investigate risky choice in settings in which people learn about options by experiential sampling over time. This article reviews work across three experiential paradigms. Converging findings show that when people make decisions based on experience, rare events tend to have less impact than they deserve according to their objective probabilities. Striking similarities in human and animal experience-based choices, ways of modeling these choices, and their implications for risk and precautionary behavior are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A performance theory for conflict detection in air traffic control is presented that specifies how controllers adapt decisions to compensate for environmental constraints. This theory is then used as a framework for a model that can fit controller intervention decisions. The performance theory proposes that controllers apply safety margins to ensure separation between aircraft. These safety margins are formed through experience and reflect the biasing of decisions to favor safety over accuracy, as well as expectations regarding uncertainty in aircraft trajectory. In 2 experiments, controllers indicated whether they would intervene to ensure separation between pairs of aircraft. The model closely predicted the probability of controller intervention across the geometry of problems and as a function of controller experience. When controller safety margins were manipulated via task instructions, the parameters of the model changed in the predicted direction. The strength of the model over existing and alternative models is that it better captures the uncertainty and decision biases involved in the process of conflict detection.

abstract = {Models of the representation of numerosity information used in discrimination tasks are integrated with a diffusion decision model. The representation models assume distributions of numerosity either with means and SD that increase linearly with numerosity or with means that increase logarithmically with constant SD. The models produce coefficients that are applied to differences between two numerosities to produce drift rates and these drive the decision process. The linear and log models make differential predictions about how response time (RT) distributions and accuracy change with numerosity and which model is successful depends on the task. When the task is to decide which of two side-by-side arrays of dots has more dots, the log model fits decreasing accuracy and increasing RT as numerosity increases. When the task is to decide, for dots of two colors mixed in a single array, which color has more dots, the linear model fits decreasing accuracy and decreasing RT as numerosity increases. For both tasks, variables such as the areas covered by the dots affect performance, but if the task is changed to one in which the subject has to decide whether the number of dots in a single array is more or less than a standard, the variables have little effect on performance. Model parameters correlate across tasks suggesting commonalities in the abilities to perform them. Overall, results show that the representation used depends on the task and no single representation can account for the data from all the paradigms.},

Consequently, means that are connected to multiple (vs. single) goals are less likely to be chosen and pursued when only one of these goals is activated.},

A computational framework for interventional causal learning has been developed over the last decade, but how real causal learners might achieve or approximate the computations entailed by this framework is still poorly understood. Here we describe an interactive computer task in which participants were incentivized to learn the structure of probabilistic causal systems through free selection of multiple interventions. We develop models of participants' intervention choices and online structure judgments, using expected utility gain, probability gain, and information gain and introducing plausible memory and processing constraints. We find that successful participants are best described by a model that acts to maximize information (rather than expected score or probability of being correct); that forgets much of the evidence received in earlier trials; but that mitigates this by being conservative, preferring structures consistent with earlier stated beliefs. We explore 2 heuristics that partly explain how participants might be approximating these models without explicitly representing or updating a hypothesis space.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Safety hazards are unavoidable in many work environments. Employees must be both productive and safe, however, conflicting safety and production demands can negatively affect safety, production, or both. The employee's perception of the compatibility of management's safety and production expectations is a possible predictor of such consequences. This paper defines "safety-production compatibility" and describes how measures of safety-production compatibility, as well as safety pressure and production pressure, were developed. METHOD: We used LISREL structural equation modeling to test the influences of safety-production compatibility, safety pressure, and production pressure on safe work behavior and interference with performing other work tasks. The 239 study participants were workers employed in diverse but hazardous occupations. RESULTS: Pressure to work safely was positively associated with safe work behavior. The perceived compatibility of safety and production demands positively influenced safe work behavior and reduced the interference of safety hazards performing other tasks. Safety-production compatibility was also found to mediate the relationship between trust in management and safe work behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this field study suggest increased compatibility, and thus less conflict, between safety and production demands influences safe work behavior and the interference of safety hazards with performing other work tasks. More broadly, the worker's reaction to multiple work demands is a safety and performance influence. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Safety management efforts that focus only on the hazards fail to eliminate many accidents because accidents arise from many factors including technology, safety climate, social influences, production, and safety demands. This study suggests that workers differ in their perception of the compatibility of safety and production demands. These differences will show up in safe work behavior, influencing the effectiveness of safety management efforts and the trust workers have in management's concern for safety.},

@article{Grand2017,
abstract = {Stereotype threat describes the situation where an individual is faced with the risk of upholding a negative stereotype about a subgroup to which that person belongs based on his/her actions (Steele {\&} Aronson, 1995). Empirical investigations of stereotype threat effects across a variety of individuals, subgroups, and contexts have identified a number of undesirable consequences related to performance on domain-relevant tasks (e.g., Nguyen {\&} Ryan, 2008; Steele, 1997; Steele {\&} Aronson, 1998; Steele, Spencer {\&} Aronson, 2002). Efforts to identify the psychological mechanisms and processes most directly affected by stereotype threat have indicated that one of its most detrimental influences is exerted on individuals' working memory capacity. More specifically, the added cognitive and emotional-regulatory strain introduced by the presence of stereotype threat uses up a portion of one's limited working memory capacity, thus "hijacking" cognitive resources that could otherwise have been put towards completing task-relevant activities/performance (Schmader, Johns, {\&} Forbes, 2008). Given the importance of working memory to the development of new knowledge, skills, and abilities (cf., Feldman Barrett, Tugade, {\&} Engle, 2004), the primary goal of the present investigation was to extend and build upon recent research examining the acquisition of task-relevant knowledge by individuals facing conditions of stereotype threat during their learning activities (Rydell, Rydell, {\&} Boucher, 2010; Rydell, Shiffrin, Boucher, Van Loo, {\&} Rydell, 2010). Guided by an empirically grounded taxonomy of critical learning outcomes (Kraiger, Ford, {\&} Salas, 1993), the knowledge organization and development of task strategies were examined for 145 female learners assigned into either stereotype threat or control conditions. Individuals were tasked with learning to operate a low-fidelity computer-based radar tracking simulation over the course of three experimental sessions held on consecutive days. Based on principles of active learning (Bell {\&} Kozlowski, 2008), the presentation of content/materials followed an exploratory learning paradigm which facilitates task comprehension through the use/improvement of learners' inferential reasoning capabilities (e.g., McDaniel {\&} Schlager, 1990). Key findings of this study indicated that, unlike females who learned the task under control conditions, females facing stereotype threat experienced the greatest difficulty acquiring effective heuristics critical to improving task performance. Examination of participants' knowledge structures revealed that although female learners under stereotype threat were capable of deducing advanced relations amongst relevant task concepts over time, they appeared to do so in a manner that was far less efficient and, consequently, less conducive to performance when required to apply their knowledge in more demanding task conditions. Further analyses indicated that females under conditions of stereotype threat were not only less accurate at applying their learned knowledge to task-critical decisions, but the manner in which they had learned to interpret information presented to them in the task was generally also less optimal. Lastly, the observed pattern of results revealed that the above effects did not manifest immediately during initial onset of learning activities and required time for meaningful differences to emerge, suggesting that longitudinal examinations of stereotype threat effects are an important direction for future research.

The original qualitative model was elaborated to quantitative versions that included the ultradian dynamics of sleep in relation to the non-REM-REM sleep cycle. The time course of EEG slow-wave activity, the major marker of non-REM sleep homeostasis, as well as daytime alertness were simulated successfully for a considerable number of experimental protocols. They include sleep after partial sleep deprivation and daytime napping, sleep in habitual short and long sleepers, and alertness in a forced desynchrony protocol or during an extended photoperiod. Simulations revealed that internal desyn-chronization can be obtained for different shapes of the thresholds. New developments include the analysis of the waking EEG to delineate homeostatic and circadian processes, studies of REM sleep homeostasis, and recent evidence for local, use-dependent sleep processes. Moreover, nonlinear interactions between homeostatic and circadian processes were identified. In the past two decades, models have contributed considerably to conceptualizing and analyzing the major processes underlying sleep regulation, and they are likely to play an important role in future advances in the field.},

Subjective cognitive effort and perceived difficulty were measured while individuals performed an air traffic control task. As expected, Conscientiousness moderated the effort trajectory. Individuals with high Conscientiousness maintained subjective cognitive effort at high levels for longer than their counterparts. There were also individual differences in reactions to perceptions of task difficulty. The intra-individual relationship between perceived difficulty and subjective cognitive effort was stronger for individuals with low ability or low Conscientiousness than for their counterparts. A follow-up study showed that the measures of perceived difficulty and subjective cognitive effort were sensitive to a task difficulty manipulation as well as that the relationship between perceived difficulty and subjective cognitive effort held after controlling for self-set goal level. These findings contribute to the self-regulation literature by identifying factors that influence changes in subjective cognitive effort during skill acquisition.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irregular working hours severely disturb sleep and wakefulness. This paper presents a modification of the quantitative (computerised) three process model of regulation of alertness to predict duration of sleep in connection with irregular sleep patterns. METHODS: The model uses a circadian "C" (sinusoidal) and homeostatic "S" (exponential) component (the duration of previous periods awake and asleep), which are summed to yield predicted alertness (on a scale of 1-16). It assumes that waking from sleep will occur at a given alertness level (S' + C') when recuperation is complete. Variables of electroencephalographic duration of sleep from two studies of irregular sleep were used to model the S and C variables in a regression approach to maximise prediction. The model performance was cross validated against published field and laboratory data. RESULTS: The model parameters were defined with a high degree of precision R2 = 0.99 and the validation yielded similar values R2 = 0.98-0.95, depending on the acrophase. The paper also describes a simplified graphical version of the computation model seen as a two dimensional duration of sleep nomogram. CONCLUSION: The model seems to predict group means for duration of sleep with high precision and may serve as a tool for evaluating work and rest schedules to reduce risks of sleep disturbances.},

In addition, the way a problem is presented can influence people's choices, which creates what are known as framing effects. In this research, we explored how time pressure interacts with framing effects in risky decision making. Specifically, does time pressure strengthen or weaken framing effects? On one hand, research has suggested that framing effects evolve through the deliberation process, growing larger with time. On the other hand, dual-process theory attributes framing effects to an intuitive, emotional system that responds automatically to stimuli. In our experiments, participants made decisions about gambles framed in terms of either gains or losses, and time pressure was manipulated across blocks. Results showed increased framing effects under time pressure in both hypothetical and incentivized choices, which supports the dual-process hypothesis that these effects arise from a fast, intuitive system.

@article{Finkel,
abstract = {Finkel, Eastwick, and Reis (2015; FER2015) argued that psychological science is better served by responding to apprehensions about replicability rates with contextualized solutions than with one-size-fits-all solutions. Here, we extend FER2015's analysis to suggest that much of the discussion of best research practices since 2011 has focused on a single feature of high-quality science—replicability—with insufficient sensitivity to the implications of recommended practices for other features, like discovery, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, consequentiality, and cumulativeness. Thus, al-though recommendations for bolstering replicability have been innovative, compelling, and abundant, it is difficult to evaluate their impact on our science as a whole, especially because many research practices that are beneficial for some features of scientific quality are harmful for others. For example, FER2015 argued that bigger samples are generally better, but also noted that very large samples (" those larger than required for effect sizes to stabilize " ; p. 291) could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies. In their critique of FER2015, LeBel, Campbell, and Loving (2016) concluded, based on simulated data, that ever-larger samples are better for the efficiency of scientific discovery (i.e., that there are no tradeoffs). As demonstrated here, however, this conclusion holds only when the replicator's resources are considered in isolation. If we widen the assumptions to include the original researcher's resources as well, which is necessary if the goal is to consider resource investment for the field as a whole, the conclusion changes radically—and strongly supports a tradeoff-based analysis. In general, as psychologists seek to strengthen our science, we must complement our much-needed work on increasing replicability with careful attention to the other features of a high-quality science. The research process can be viewed as a series of interlocking choices, in which we try simultaneously to maximize several conflicting de-siderata. —McGrath, 1981, p. 179 (italics in original) When pursuing the goal of conducting high-quality science, researchers must learn to live with intractable dilemmas, making decisions that optimize a study's overall scientific contribution despite the fact that no method can produce maximal value on every feature of good science. McGrath (1981) illustrated this point by demonstrating that external validity, experimental control, and experimental realism—three features that are, in isolation, unmitigated scientific goods—are inherently incompatible, be-cause maximizing one of them makes it impossible to maximize the others. In the terminology of our " Best Research Practices in Psychology " article (Finkel, et al., 2015; FER2015), all research strategies involve tradeoffs among the desirable features of a high-quality science—among McGrath's " desiderata. " Conse-quently, in FER2015, we expressed enthusiasm for the increased attention that scholars have brought to the issue of replicability since 2011 (e.g., Klein et al., 2014; Open Science Collaboration, 2015), but we also noted that many current proposals for improv-ing replicability could unintentionally weaken other features of a high-quality science. Without such tradeoff-based thinking, we argued, the field cannot even ask questions regarding whether a given research practice is ultimately beneficial or harmful for our science as a whole (i.e., across the full range of desirable features), even if it is clearly beneficial for a particular feature (e.g., repli-cability). Building on FER2015's appeal for tradeoff-based thinking, LeBel et al. (2016; LCL2016) considered the costs and benefits of certain research practices. Especially innovative was their simul-taneous consideration of the scientific features of discovery (i.e., finding evidence in support of novel hypotheses) and replicability (i.e., finding that results emerge in other random samples that capture the most important facets of the research design; Asend-orpf et al., 2013). LCL2016 tested the potential tradeoff between},

abstract = {Managing highly skilled employees is extremely complex because of the need to balance the costs and time lags associated with their training against the need to meet demand as quickly as possible. Unlike previous approaches to this problem in the staffing literature, this paper develops an optimal staffing policy at the strategic level to cope with nonstationary stochastic demand for a staff characterized by unproductive apprentice employees and fully productive experienced employees. The paper then explores the implications of this policy in different industries, using empirical data. Aside from the optimal policy, this paper's primary results include: (1) demand volatility reduces average productivity, most especially under conditions of low (or slightly negative) growth and - nonintuitively - low employee turnover or knowledge obsolescence rates; (2) there is a trade-off between meeting demand and high productivity; (3) firms with longer business cycles should smooth their hiring and firing policies; and (4) firms in industries with longer training times should smooth their hiring and firing policies. The paper also explores the possible rewards from reducing training times and turnover rates. Finally, it discusses managerial implications and possible future directions in research.

abstract = {Classical queueing theory has typically focused on customers, while server availability has been taken for granted. However, data accessibility and the emergence of complex service sys-tems, for example call centers, revealed the need to stochastically model the complex behavior of servers. In this work, we propose a new model that accommodates such behavior; we call it Erlang-S, where " S " stands for Servers. Our model assumes a pool of present servers, some of whom are available to serve customers from the queue while others are not, and the process of becoming available or unavailable is modeled explicitly. Our focus here is on applying the model to real systems, specifically call centers. Estimating the parameters of the new model from call center data is challenging since reality is observed discretely in time, as opposed to its contin-uous evolution. We thus use an EM algorithm that computes the expected number of relevant quantities given the discrete-time data. Erlang-S differs from the Erlang-A model, which has been commonly used for modeling call centers: the latter model assumes that all agents who are present are in fact available for service. When comparing predictions of the two models against call center data, we find that Erlang-A generally overestimates queue length and consequently also the fraction of abandonment, while Erlang-S predicts reality more closely and usefully. Our conclusion is that it is important to model explicitly server dynamics, in order to obtain accurate and valuable models of complex service systems.},

Over the years, this has been successful in giving an integrated account not only of data from normal adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Psychology as an empirical science progresses through the development of formal models incorporating theoretical ideas designed to explain and predict observations of psy-chological phenomena. This means that progress in psychol-ogy relies upon the quality and completeness of the methods it uses to relate models and data. There is little point in devel-oping theories and models, on the one hand, and collecting data in the laboratory or the field, on the other, if the two cannot be brought into contact in useful ways. In most empirical sciences, Bayesian methods have been or are rapidly being adopted as the most complete and co-herent available way to relate models and data. Psychology has long been aware of problems with traditional frequent-ist and null hypothesis significance-testing approaches to parameter estimation and model selection, and recognition of the Bayesian alternative has followed from a number of recent articles and special volumes addressing the general. Beyond the illustrative applications provided in these general treatments, however, there are few worked examples of Bayesian methods being applied to models at the forefront of modern psychological theorizing. Perhaps one reason is that there has been too great a focus on model selection defined in a narrow sense—particularly through the evaluation of Bayes factors—rather than a full Bayes-ian analysis. The perception that all that Bayesian methods have to offer for the evaluation of psychological models is a number that quantifies how much more likely one model is than another is dangerously limiting. In this article, three previous cognitive-modeling studies are revisited, in an attempt to demonstrate the generality and usefulness of the Bayesian approach. The three appli-cations involve the multidimensional scaling (MDS) rep-resentation of stimulus similarity (Shepard, 1962, 1980), the generalized context model (GCM) account of category learning (Nosofsky, 1984, 1986), and a signal detection theory (SDT) account of inductive and deductive reasoning (Heit {\&} Rotello, 2005). These applications were chosen in order to span a range of cognitive phenomena, to involve well-known and influential theories, and to put a focus on the ability of Bayesian methods to provide useful answers to important theoretical and empirical questions.

Extensive changes have been made to the previous version, incorporating recent information relating to a variety of issues including cumulative fatigue, time of day, shift length, the effect of breaks and the recovery from a sequence of shifts. In addition, a review has been carried out of trends in risk related to shift work, and this has enabled the final version to incorporate two separate indices, one related to fatigue (the Fatigue Index) and the other to risk (the Risk Index). While the two indices are similar in many respects they diverge in others. The main differences are due to the different trends with respect to time of day in fatigue and risk. The index has been implemented in the form of a spreadsheet, the design of which has incorporated feedback from users of the previous index. Further work has been undertaken to determine whether a separate FI would be required for permanent night workers. It was concluded that suitability of the FI would depend on the degree of adaptation to the night shift. This report and the work it describes were funded by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

abstract = {In soccer penalty kicks, goalkeepers choose their action before they can clearly observe the kick direction. An analysis of 286 penalty kicks in top leagues and championships worldwide shows that given the probability distribution of kick direction, the optimal strategy for goalkeepers is to stay in the goal's center. Goalkeepers, however, almost always jump right or left. We propose the following explanation for this behavior: because the norm is to jump, norm theory (Kahneman, D., {\&} Miller, D. T. (1986). Norm theory: Comparing reality to its alternatives. Psychological Review, 93, 136-153) implies that a goal scored yields worse feelings for the goalkeeper following inaction (staying in the center) than following action (jumping), leading to a bias for action. The omission bias, a bias in favor of inaction, is reversed here because the norm here is reversed - to act rather than to choose inaction. The claim that jumping is the norm is supported by a second study, a survey conducted with 32 top professional goalkeepers. The seemingly biased decision making is particularly striking since the goalkeepers have huge incentives to make correct decisions, and it is a decision they encounter frequently. Finally, we discuss several implications of the action/omission bias for economics and management. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When working as a member of a team, individuals must make decisions concerning the allocation of resources (e.g., effort) toward individual goals and team goals. As a result, individual and team goals, and feedback related to progress toward these goals, should be potent levers for affecting resource allocation decisions. This research develops a multilevel, multiple-goal model of individual and team regulatory processes that affect the allocation of resources across individual and team goals resulting in individual and team performance. On the basis of this model, predictions concerning the impact of individual and team performance feedback are examined empirically to evaluate the model and to understand the influence of feedback on regulatory processes and resource allocation. Two hundred thirty-seven participants were randomly formed into 79 teams of 3 that performed a simulated radar task that required teamwork. Results support the model and the predicted role of feedback in affecting the allocation of resources when individuals strive to accomplish both individual and team goals.},

@article{Rick2008,
abstract = {Since the advent of the discounted utility (DU) model, economists have thought about intertemporal choice in very specific terms. DU assumes that people make explicit trade-offs between costs and benefits occurring at different points in time. While this explicit trade-off perspective is simple and tractable, and has stimulated productive research, it does not provide a very realistic representation of a wide range of the most important intertemporal trade-offs that people face in daily life. If one considers the most important and commonly discussed examples of intertemporal choices, a striking pattern emerges: in almost all cases, early outcomes tend to be concrete (e.g. purchasing this latte), but later outcomes tend to be much less tangible (e.g. the unknown item that could have been purchased later with the money spent on this latte). We propose that people rely on anticipatory emotions as a proxy for intangible outcomes when trade-offs are implicit. This paper reviews neuroeconomic evidence that has begun to elucidate the role of anticipatory emotions in decisions involving intangible outcomes. Although most progress has been made in the domain of spending and saving, we discuss how the existing neuroeconomic research could be extended to other domains where trade-offs are ill defined.},

abstract = {Discrete-event simulations for futuristic unmanned vehicle (UV) systems enable a cost- and time-effective methodology for evaluating various autonomy and human-automation design parameters. Operator mental workload is an important factor to consider in such models. We suggest that the effects of operator workload on system performance can be modeled in such a simulation environment through a quantitative relation between operator attention and utilization, i.e., operator busy time used as a surrogate real-time workload measure. To validate our model, a heterogeneous UV simulation experiment was conducted with 74 participants. Performance-based measures of attention switching delays were incorporated in the discrete-event simulation model by UV wait times due to operator attention inefficiencies (WTAIs). Experimental results showed that WTAI is significantly associated with operator utilization (UT) such that high UT levels correspond to higher wait times. The inclusion of this empirical UT-WTAI relation in the discrete-event simulation model of multiple UV supervisory control resulted in more accurate replications of data, as well as more accurate predictions for alternative UV team structures. These results have implications for the design of future human-UV systems, as well as more general multiple task supervisory control models.},

abstract = {In optimal stopping problems, people are asked to choose the best option out of a sequence of alternatives, under the constraint that they cannot return to an earlier option once it is rejected. We examine human performance on variations of the optimal stopping problem, with different environments and with different goals. Specifically, we consider environments that have relatively high or low numbers, under the goals of choosing the maximum or the minimum. A natural conse-quence of this design is that we study the decisions that people make in both congruent situations, where the environment and goal align, and incongruent situations, where the environment and goal differ. First, we present empirical evidence that people adapt to both high and low environments as well as to both maximum and minimum goal frames, and that they make decisions consistent with using threshold-based models. Secondly, we apply a previously-developed threshold model of individual performance to our data, inferring the thresholds people use. Lastly, we use Bayes factors to test whether people are sensitive to environments, goals, and congruency in optimal stopping problems. Overall, our results suggest that there are psychological similarities in congruent situations, pointing towards invariances and rationalities in the way people solve optimal stopping problems as the environments and goals change, without contaminating framing effects.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown the effect of a lead vehicle's speed, deceleration rate and headway distance on drivers' brake response times. However, how drivers perceive this information and use it to determine when to apply braking is still not quite clear. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, a driving simulator experiment was performed where each participant experienced nine deceleration scenarios. Previously reported effects of the lead vehicle's speed, deceleration rate and headway distance on brake response time were firstly verified in this paper, using a multilevel model. Then, as an alternative to measures of speed, deceleration rate and distance, two visual looming-based metrics (angular expansion rate $\theta$˙ of the lead vehicle on the driver's retina, and inverse tau $\tau$-1, the ratio between $\theta$˙ and the optical size $\theta$), considered to be more in line with typical human psycho-perceptual responses, were adopted to quantify situation urgency. These metrics were used in two previously proposed mechanistic models predicting brake onset: either when looming surpasses a threshold, or when the accumulated evidence (looming and other cues) reaches a threshold. Results showed that the looming threshold model did not capture the distribution of brake response time. However, regardless of looming metric, the accumulator models fitted the distribution of brake response times better than the pure threshold models. Accumulator models, including brake lights, provided a better model fit than looming-only versions. For all versions of the mechanistic models, models using $\tau$-1as the measure of looming fitted better than those using $\theta$˙, indicating that the visual cues drivers used during rear-end collision avoidance may be more close to $\tau$-1.},

Contrary to this hypothesis, we show in a double dissociation that the two have independent effects on the learning and retention components of motor adaptation. Negative feedback, whether graded or binary, accelerated learning. While it was not necessary for the negative feedback to be coupled to monetary loss, it had to be clearly related to the actual performance on the preceding movement. Positive feedback did not speed up learning, but it increased retention of the motor memory when performance feedback was withdrawn. These findings reinforce the view that independent mechanisms underpin learning and retention in motor adaptation, reject the assumption that motor adaptation is independent of motivational feedback, and raise new questions regarding the neural basis of negative and positive motivational feedback in motor learning.},

The flexibility of our fatigue model allowed additions of new algorithms and mechanisms for non-sleep factors and countermeasures and thus improved model predictions and usability for both civilian and military applications. This was demonstrated by model simulations of various scenarios and comparison with experimental studies. Our future work will be focused on model validation and integration with other modelling tools. Practitioner Summary: Mental fatigue affects health, safety and quality of life in our modern society.

The trade-off (Scholten, Read, {\&} Sanborn, 2014) and the proportional difference models (Gonz{\'{a}}lez-Vallejo, 2002) were used to represent the attribute-wise mechanism. A stochastic version of the hyperbolic model based on Rachlin (2006) was adopted to represent the alternative-wise mechanism. Three experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, a typical intertemporal indifference choice task with a fixed delayed amount was used. In Experiment 2, a general choice task with nonimmediate delays and varied attribute values was em-ployed. The magnitude effect was embedded in this experiment. In Experiment 3, the models were tested with option sets designed to induce subadditive and superadditive choice patterns (Scholten {\&} Read, 2006, 2010). In Experiment 1, the hyperbolic model performed as well as the other models. In Experiments 2 and 3, the attribute-wise models outperformed the alternative-wise model in terms of fit, prediction, and handling of nonadditive patterns. The results support conclusions from recent studies (Dai {\&} Buse-meyer, 2014; Scholten et al., 2014), which suggest that attribute-wise mechanisms may be more suitable for describing intertemporal choices. Furthermore, the predictive perfor-mance was similar between the trade-off and the proportional difference (PD) models though the PD model is simpler.},

A variety of studies have demonstrated that variables have different effects on remember and know responses, and these findings have been interpreted in the context of dual-process models of recognition memory. This paper presents a single-process model of the remember-know paradigm, emphasizing the dependence of remember and know judgments on a set of common underlying processes (e.g., criterion setting). We use this model to demonstrate how a single-process model can give rise to the functional dissociations presented in the remember-know literature. We close by detailing procedures for testing our model and describing how those tests may facilitate the development of dual-process models.},

In addition, the study examined the moderating roles of daily task significance, daily family interference with work, and commuting means efficacy in this mediation model. Results from 45 bus commuters' daily diary data over a period of 15 workdays indicated that the amount of morning commuting stressors experienced by the bus commuters was positively related to their morning commuting strain, which, in turn, had a negative impact on self‐regulation at work. At the within‐person level, daily task significance buffered the negative indirect relationship between morning commuting stressors and self‐regulation at work via morning commuting strain, whereas daily family interference with work in the morning exacerbated this negative indirect relationship. Further, at the between‐person level, commuting means efficacy buffered this negative indirect relationship such that the negative indirect effect was weaker for workers with higher (vs. lower) commuting means efficacy. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

abstract = {A great deal of behavioral and economic research suggests that the value attached to a reward stands in inverse relation to the amount of effort required to obtain it, a principle known as effort discounting. In the current report, we present the first direct evidence for a neural analogue of effort discounting. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses to monetary rewards in the human nucleus accumbens, a structure previously demonstrated to encode reference-dependent reward information. The magnitude of accumbens activation was found to vary with reward outcome, but also with the degree of mental effort demanded to obtain individual rewards. For a fixed level of reward, accumbens was less strongly activated following a high demand for effort than following a lower demand. The magnitude of this effect was noted to correlate with preceding activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region that has been proposed to monitor information-processing demands and to mediate in the subjective experience of effort.

However, performance on this task is confounded by complex interdependencies between cognitive, motivational, and response processes, making it difficult to sort out and identify the specific processes responsible for the observed behavioral deficits. The authors compare 3 competing cognitive decision models of the Bechara task in terms of their ability to explain the performance deficits observed in Huntington's disease patients as compared with healthy populations and people with Parkinson's disease. The parameters of the best fitting model are used to decompose the observed performance deficit of the Huntington patients into cognitive, motivational, and response sources.},

The goal-gradient hypothesis states that the motivation to reach a goal increases with proximity to the goal. The issue – of interest to academics and website managers alike – is to understand the role played by badges on the quantity and quality of user contributions. Our dataset enables us to measure activity levels both quantitatively and qualitatively. We find that the quantity of user contributions increases substantially in the days shortly before earning the next badge, and peak on the day of the promotion, whereas the quality of user contributions declines only slightly. Hence, our findings empirically support the goal-gradient hypothesis in the context of online communities, and provide nuanced insights into the effect of badges on online user behavior.},

Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point-in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality-constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.},

While animals can adopt a statistically optimal policy for this tradeoff, findings about human decision-makers have been mixed. Some studies have shown that people can optimize this " speed–accuracy tradeoff " , while others have identified a systematic bias towards excessive cau-tion. These issues have driven theoretical development and spurred debate about the nature of human decision-making. We investigated a potential resolution to the debate, based on two factors that routinely differ between human and ani-mal studies of decision-making: the effects of practice, and of longer-term feedback. Our study replicated the finding that most people, by default, are overly cautious. When given both practice and detailed feedback, people moved rapidly towards the optimal policy, with many participants reaching optimality with less than 1 h of practice. Our find-ings have theoretical implications for cognitive and neural models of simple decision-making, as well as methodologi-cal implications.},

abstract = {Psychologists have studied small-group and team effectiveness for decades, and although there has been considerable progress, there remain significant challenges. Meta-analyses and systematic research have provided solid evidence for core team cognitive, motivational, affective, and behavioral processes that contribute to team effectiveness and empirical support for interventions that enhance team processes (e.g., team design, composition, training, and leadership); there has been substantial evidence for a science of team effectiveness. Nonetheless, there have also been concerns that team processes, which are inherently dynamic, have primarily been assessed as static constructs. Team-level processes and outcomes are multilevel phenomena that emerge, bottom-up from the interactions among team members over time, under the shifting demands of a work context. Thus, theoretical development that appropriately conceptualizes the multiple levels, process dynamics, and emergence of team phenomena over time are essential to advance understanding. Moreover, these conceptual advances necessitate innovative research methodologies to better capture team process dynamics. We explicate this foundation and then describe 2 promising streams of scientific inquiry—team interaction sensors and computational modeling—that are advancing new, unobtrusive measurement techniques and process-oriented research methods focused on understanding the dynamics of cohesion and cognition in teamwork. These are distinct lines of research, each endeavoring to advance the science, but doing so through the development of very different methodologies. We close by discussing the near-term research challenges and the potential long-term evolution of these innovative methods, with an eye toward the future for process-oriented theory and research on team effectiveness.

The authors investigated risk taking under differential involvement of affective versus deliberative processes with 2 versions of the CCT, constituting the most direct test of a dual-system explanation of adolescent risk taking in the literature so far. The "hot" CCT was designed to trigger more affective decision making, whereas the "cold" CCT was designed to trigger more deliberative decision making. Differential involvement of affective versus deliberative processes in the 2 CCT versions was established by self-reports and assessment of electrodermal activity. Increased adolescent risk taking, coupled with simplified information use, was found in the hot but not the cold condition. Need-for-arousal predicted risk taking only in the hot condition, whereas executive functions predicted information use in the cold condition. Results are consistent with recent dual-system explanations of risk taking as the result of competition between affective processes and deliberative cognitive-control processes, with adolescents' affective system tending to override the deliberative system in states of heightened emotional arousal.},

abstract = {Twenty four pilots flew simulated missions in an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) simulator under both single and dual UAV control, and in three conditions: a baseline condition, a condition in which certain information was displayed auditorally, to offload the heavy visual demands of the mission, and a condition in which flight path tracking was automated. Three tasks were performed within each UAV workstation: (1) Meeting the mission goals, by flying to 10 command target waypoints and reporting intelligence information at each of these command targets, (2) monitoring a 3D image display for targets of opportunity on the ground below the flight path,(3) monitoring the health of on-board system parameters. Upon reaching a command target, or seeing a target of opportunity, pilots were required to enter a loiter pattern, zoom in and inspect the image. Pilots could also retrieve command target coordinates and report information at any time they wished. The data were evaluated in the context of three models of concurrent task performance, strict single channel theory, single resource theory and multiple resource theory. The results indicated a cost to dual UAV control in all three tasks, although this cost varied in its magnitude. The results also indicated that both the auditory and the automation assistance improved performance, and reduced the dual task decrement, relative to the baseline condition. In particular, the auditory display of system parameter failures enabled a large degree of parallel processing. Various analyses were carried out to examine the extent to which models based on each of the three attention theories were adequate in predicting the data. Some aspects of the data were consistent with each model. Thus a valid model to account for all aspects of the task would need to incorporate mechanisms based on each model.

abstract = {Avoidance goal regulation involves acting to distance one-self from something undesired; whereas approach goal regu-lation involves acting to obtain something desired. Although the ability to avoid undesired outcomes is crucial for sur-vival (Roskes et al. 2014), avoidance goals have received far less empirical and theoretical attention than approach goals within the self-regulation literature. For example, approach goal regulation has been represented in dynamic, formal models based on the negative feedback loop architecture found in control theory (Powers 1973; Scherbaum and Van-couver 2010; Vancouver et al. 2005, 2010, 2014; Vancouver and Scherbaum 2008). Moreover, these models have been evaluated based on data available from observational and experimental studies using longitudinal designs that enable researchers to examine the dynamics of the approach goal regulation process (e.g., Kernan and Lord 1990; Schmidt and DeShon 2007; Schmidt et al. 2009; Schmidt and Dolis 2009). This level of theoretical rigor has not occurred in the avoidance goal regulation context. Therefore, despite its importance, the avoidance goal regulation process is still not well understood. To address this issue, we present a dynamic, formal the-ory that describes the process of avoidance goal regulation. The model is based on the same feedback control system architecture that has been used to understand approach goal regulation. We develop two versions of the model using this architecture—one that assumes avoidance goal regulation is regulated by a positive feedback loop and another that assumes the process is regulated by a negative feedback loop. We then present a set of simulations that show the dynamic pattern of behavior that each model generates over Abstract An avoidance goal is an undesired state from which a person seeks to distance themselves. Though important for understanding behavior, avoidance goals have received less attention than approach goals. In this paper, we present a dynamic, formal model that provides a frame-work for describing and predicting the dynamics of avoid-ance goal regulation. We conduct a series of simulations to examine the dynamic pattern of behavior that emerges from the model when an avoidance goal is pursued in isolation and when an approach goal is also present. Two versions of the model were examined. In the first, the avoidance goal is regulated by a positive feedback loop. In the second, the avoidance goal is regulated by a negative feedback loop. We find that the positive feedback model produces a pattern of runaway behavior, even in a scenario where an approach goal is also present. By contrast, the negative feedback loop model produces a stable pattern of behavior that is more con-sistent with existing theory. The findings provide an impor-tant step toward theoretical parsimony by demonstrating that avoidance goal regulation, like approach goal regulation, can be understood using a negative feedback control system framework. We discuss new insights provided by this model and its potential to spark empirical research.},

abstract = {Prospect Theory proposed that the (dis)utility of losses is always more than gains due to a phenomena called 'loss-aversion', a result obtained in multiple later studies over the years. However, some researchers found reversed or no loss-aversion for affective judgments of small monetary amounts but, those findings have been argued to stem from the way gains versus losses were measured. Thus, it was not clear whether loss-aversion does not show with affective judgments for smaller magnitudes, or it is a measurement error. This paper addresses the debate concerning loss-aversion (in the prospect theoretic sense) and judgments about the intensity of gains and losses. We measured affective prospective judgments for monetary amounts using measurement scales that have been argued to be suitable for measuring loss-aversion and hence rule out any explanations regarding measurement. Both in a gambling scenario (Experiments 1 and 2) and in the context of fluctuating prices (Experiments 3a and 3b), potential losses never loomed larger than gains for low magnitudes, indicating that it is not simply a measurement error. Moreover, for the same participant, loss aversion was observable at high magnitudes. Further, we show that loss-aversion disappears even for higher monetary values, if contextually an even larger anchor is provided. The results imply that Prospect Theory's value function is contextually dependent on magnitudes.},

We focus on an important aspect of this debate, the impact of sample sizes, by assessing sample sizes within sport and exercise psychology. Researchers have argued that publications in psychological research contain numerous false-positive findings and inflated effect sizes due to small sample sizes. Method: We analyse the four leading journals in sport and exercise psychology regarding sample sizes of all quantitative studies published in these journals between 2009 and 2013. Subsequently, we conduct power analyses. Results: A substantial proportion of published studies does not have sufficient power to detect effect sizes typical for psychological research. Sample sizes and power vary between research designs. Although many correlational studies have adequate sample sizes, experimental studies are often underpowered to detect small-to-medium effects. Conclusions: As sample sizes are small, research in sport and exercise psychology may suffer from false-positive results and inflated effect sizes, while at the same time failing to detect meaningful small effects. Larger sample sizes are warranted, particularly in experimental studies.},

The physiological implementation of this slow ultradian brain rhythm is largely unknown. Two differing dynamical mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the NREM–REM cycle. The first model type relies on reciprocal interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neural populations resulting in stable limit cycle oscillations. Recent experimental findings instead favor a model, in which mutually inhibitory interactions between REM sleep-promoting (REM-on) and REM sleep-suppressing (REM-off) neural populations stabilize the brain state. Slow modulations in the neural excitability, that are hypothesized to reflect the homeostatic need for REM sleep, abruptly switch the brain in and out of REM sleep.},

abstract = {The rationality principle postulates that decision-makers always choose the best action available to them. It underlies most modern theories of decision-making. The principle does not take into account the difficulty of finding the best option. Here, we propose that computational complexity theory (CCT) provides a framework for defining and quantifying the difficulty of decisions. We review evidence showing that human decision-making is affected by computational complexity. Building on this evidence, we argue that most models of decision-making, and metacognition, are intractable from a computational perspective. To be plausible, future theories of decision-making will need to take into account both the resources required for implementing the computations implied by the theory, and the resource constraints imposed on the decision-maker by biology. New research showing that the quality of human decision-making decreases with the computational complexity of decision problems challenges the core assumption of most models of decision-making: that decision-makers always optimise. CCT can help explain behavioural biases, such as choice overload and negative elasticity of labour supply. Integrating CCT with decision theory and neurobiology promises to lay the foundations of a more realistic theory of decision-making and metacognition.},

abstract = {The psychometric function relates an observer's performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task. This paper, together with its companion paper (Wichmann {\&} Hill, 2001), describes an integrated approach to (1) fitting psychometric functions, (2) assessing the goodness of fit, and (3) providing confidence intervals for the function's parameters and other estimates derived from them, for the purposes of hypothesis testing. The present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. First, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (or lapses). We show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function's parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. Second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. We demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditional chi2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of Monte Carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. We have made available the software to implement our methods.},

@article{Kruschke2018,
abstract = {In the practice of data analysis, there is a con-ceptual distinction between hypothesis testing, on the one hand, and estimation with quantified uncertainty on the other. Among frequentists in psychology, a shift of emphasis from hypothesis testing to estimation has been dubbed " the New Statistics " (Cumming, 2014). A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Our main goal in this article is to explain how Bayesian methods achieve the goals of the New Statistics better than frequentist methods. The article reviews frequen-tist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and to estimation with confidence or credible intervals. The arti-cle also describes Bayesian approaches to meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, and power analysis. The New Statistics emphasizes a shift of emphasis away from null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to " esti-mation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis " (Cumming, 2014, p. 7). There are many reasons to eschew NHST, with its seductive lapse to black-and-white thinking about the presence or absence of effects. There are also many reasons to promote instead a cumulative sci-ence that incrementally improves estimates of magnitudes and uncertainty. These reasons were recently highlighted in a prominent statement from the American Statistical Asso-ciation (ASA; Wasserstein {\&} Lazar, 2016) that will be summarized later in this article. Recent decades have also seen repeated calls to shift emphasis away from frequentist methods to Bayesian analysis (e.g., Lindley, 1975). In this article, we review both of these recommended shifts of emphasis in the practice of data analysis, and we promote their convergence in Bayesian methods for esti-mation. The goals of the New Statistics are better achieved by Bayesian methods than by frequentist methods. In that sense, we recommend a Bayesian New Statistics. Within the domain of Bayesian methods, we have a more nuanced emphasis. Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework for hypothesis testing, so when null hypothesis testing is the crux of the research then Bayesian null hypothesis testing should be carefully used. But we also believe that typical analyses should not routinely stop with hypothesis testing alone. In that sense, we recommend a New Bayesian Statis-tics, that is, Bayesian analyses that also consider estimates of magnitudes and uncertainty, along with meta-analyses. This article begins with an extensive description of fre-quentist and Bayesian approaches to null hypothesis testing and estimation with confidence or credible intervals. Subse-quently, the article explains Bayesian approaches to meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, and power analysis. We hope to demonstrate that Bayesian approaches to all these analyses are more direct, more intuitive, and more informative than frequentist approaches.},

abstract = {Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) models are widely used to predict optimal behavioural and life history strategies. We discuss a diversity of ways to test SDP models empirically, taking as our main illustration a model of the daily singing routine of birds. One approach to verification is to quantify model parameters, but most SDP models are schematic. Because predictions are therefore qualitative, testing several predictions is desirable. How state determines behaviour (the policy) is a central prediction that should be examined directly if both state and behaviour are measurable. Complementary predictions concern how behaviour and state change through time, but information is discarded by considering behaviour rather than state, by looking only at average state rather than its distribution, and by not following individuals. We identify the various circumstances in which an individual's state/behaviour at one time is correlated with its state/behaviour at a later time. When there are several state variables the relationships between them may be informative. Often model parameters represent environmental conditions that can also be viewed as state variables. Experimental manipulation of the environment has several advantages as a test, but a problem is uncertainty over how much the organism's policy will adjust. As an example we allow birds to use different assumptions about how well past weather predicts future weather. We advocate mirroring planned empirical investigations on the computer to investigate which manipulations and predictions will best test a model.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many laypeople demonstrate excessive sensitivity to negative side effects of medical treatments, which may lead them to refuse beneficial therapies. This Internet-based experiment investigated three possible explanations for such "side effect aversion." One was derived from mental accounting, one examined the mere presence of a side effect, and one focused on computational difficulties. DESIGN: Participants (N = 5,379) were presented with a hypothetical cancer preventive treatment situation that was or was not accompanied by one or two small side effects. The side effects were either beneficial or harmful. In all conditions, the net absolute risk reduction associated with the treatment was 15{\%}. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants indicated their willingness to accept treatment and their perceptions of the treatment's effects on their overall cancer risk. RESULTS: Data were consistent only with the "mere presence" explanation of side effect aversion, the idea that side effects act as a strong negative cue that directly affects treatment appraisal. The number of negative side effects did not influence treatment willingness. CONCLUSION: Side effect aversion is a challenge to informed decision making. Specific mechanisms that produce side effect aversion should be identified.},

abstract = {This special issue explores the growing intersection between mathematical psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Mathematical psychology, and cognitive modeling more generally, has a rich history of formalizing and testing hypotheses about cognitive mechanisms within a mathematical and computational language, making exquisite predictions of how people perceive, learn, remember, and decide. Cognitive neuroscience aims to identify neural mechanisms associated with key aspects of cognition using techniques like neurophysiology, electrophysiology, and structural and functional brain imaging. These two come together in a powerful new approach called model-based cognitive neuroscience, which can both inform cognitive modeling and help to interpret neural measures. Cognitive models decompose complex behavior into representations and processes and these latent model states can be used to explain the modulation of brain states under different experimental conditions. Reciprocally, neural measures provide data that help constrain cognitive models and adjudicate between competing cognitive models that make similar predictions about behavior. As examples, brain measures are related to cognitive model parameters fitted to individual participant data, measures of brain dynamics are related to measures of model dynamics, model parameters are constrained by neural measures, model parameters or model states are used in statistical analyses of neural data, or neural and behavioral data are analyzed jointly within a hierarchical modeling framework. We provide an introduction to the field of model-based cognitive neuroscience and to the articles contained within this special issue.},

abstract = {Jones and Dzhafarov (2014) proved the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) and diffusion model (DM) of speeded choice become unfalsifiable if 2 assumptions are removed: that growth rate variability between trials follows a Gaussian distribution and that this distribution is invariant under certain experimental manipulations. The former assumption is purely technical and has never been claimed as a theoretical commitment, and the latter is logically and empirically suspect. Heathcote, Wagenmakers, and Brown (2014) questioned the distinction between theoretical and technical assumptions and argued that only the predictions of the whole model matter. We respond that it is valuable to understand how a model's predictions depend on each of its assumptions to know what is critical to an explanation and to generalize principles across phenomena or domains. Smith, Ratcliff, and McKoon (2014) claimed unfalsifiability of the generalized DM relies on parameterizations with negligible diffusion and proposed a theoretical commitment to simple growth-rate distributions. We respond that a lower bound on diffusion would be a new, ad hoc assumption, and restrictions on growth-rate distributions are only theoretically justified if one supplies a model of what determines growth-rate variability. Finally, we summarize a simulation of the DM that retains the growth-rate invariance assumption, requires the growth-rate distribution to be unimodal, and maintains a contribution of diffusion as large as in past fits of the standard model. The simulation demonstrates mimicry between models with different theoretical assumptions, showing the problems of excess flexibility are not limited to the cases to which Smith et al. objected. Evidence-accumulation models have had an enormous impact on the psychological study of speeded choice. Jones and Dzha-farov (2014) analyzed the theoretical contributions of two promi-nent exemplars of this family, the Ratcliff diffusion model (DM; e.g., Ratcliff {\&} Smith, 2004) and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA; Brown {\&} Heathcote, 2008). This analysis included math-ematical proofs that both models become unfalsifiable if two assumptions are removed. The first assumption is that the growth rate of the evidence process is normally distributed across trials for any stimulus category and experimental condition. This Gaussian growth (GG) assumption has been made purely for reasons of mathematical convenience and has never been proposed as a theoretical commitment of the models. The second assumption holds that growth-rate distributions are invariant under between-block manipulations such as speed versus accuracy instructions. We refer to this as the second selective influence assumption (SI2), because it is the second of three selective influence assumptions that the models make (only the first two were named in Jones {\&} Dzhafarov, 2014). Jones and Dzhafarov presented arguments that SI2 is theoretically suspect and contradicted by data. Thus, in the absence of a technical assumption and another assumption that is poorly supported, the models can fit any data (real or imaginary).},

abstract = {The strong situation, as formulated by social psychologists, refers to an experimental condition offering unambiguous stimuli predicting or constituting hedonically strong events that uniformly guide response sets across individuals. In relation to fear and anxiety, the strong situation results from the unambiguous threat of an imminent and dangerous stimulus that evokes the adaptive fear response among anxiety patients and healthy controls alike. The current paper describes evidence that weakening the experimental situation through reducing the certainty, temporal proximity, and/or potency of the aversive stimulus may facilitate the emergence of patient-control differences in psychobiological measures of anxious arousal. Additionally, weak situations may be useful for testing the clinical utility of anxiolytic agents, given that pharmacological treatments of anxiety disorders are not intended to reduce the adaptive, normative response likely evoked by strong threat situations.},

In this paper we present experimental evidence from an "observe or bet" task, in which people have to determine when to engage in information-seeking behavior and when to switch to reward-taking actions. In particular we focus on the comparison between people's behavior in a changing environment and their behavior in an unchanging one. Our experimental work is motivated by rational analysis of the problem that makes strong predictions about information search and reward seeking in static and changeable environments. Our results show a striking agreement between human behavior and the optimal policy, but also highlight a number of systematic differences. In particular, we find that while people often employ suboptimal strategies the first time they encounter the learning problem, most people are able to approximate the correct strategy after minimal experience. In order to describe both the manner in which people's choices are similar to but slightly different from an optimal standard, we introduce four process models for the observe or bet task and evaluate them as potential theories of human behavior.},

@article{Kerzel2012,
abstract = {Participants in this study reached from central fixation to a lateral position that either contained or was opposite to the stimulus. Cognitive conflict was induced when the stimulus and response directions did not correspond. In the Simon task, the response direction was cued by the color of the lateral stimulus, and corresponding and noncorresponding trials varied randomly in the same block of trials, resulting in high uncertainty and long reaction times (RTs). In the stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) task, participants reached toward or away from the stimulus in separate blocks of trials, resulting in low uncertainty and short RTs. In the SRC task, cognitive conflict in noncorresponding trials slowed down RTs but hardly affected reach trajectories. In the Simon task, both RTs and reach trajectories were strongly influenced by stimulus-response correspondence. Despite the overall longer RTs in the Simon task, reaches were less direct and deviated toward the stimulus in noncorresponding trials. Thus, cognitive conflict was resolved before movement initiation in the SRC task, whereas it leaked into movement execution in the Simon task. Current theories of the Simon effect, such as the gating of response activation or response code decay, are inconsistent with our results. We propose that the SRC task was decomposed as approaching and avoiding the stimulus, which is sustained by stereotyped visuomotor routines. With complex stimulus-response relationships (Simon task), responses had to be coded as leftward and rightward, with more uncertainty about how to execute the action. This uncertainty permitted cognitive conflict to leak into the movement execution.},

abstract = {This article introduces process shifts to study the temporal interplay among transition and action processes espoused in the recurring phase model proposed by Marks, Mathieu, and Zacarro (2001). Process shifts are those points in time when teams complete a focal process and change to another process. By using team communication patterns to measure process shifts, this research explores (a) when teams shift among different transition processes and initiate action processes and (b) the potential of different interventions, such as communication directives, to manipulate process shift timing and order and, ultimately, team performance. Virtual experiments are employed to compare data from observed laboratory teams not receiving interventions, simulated teams receiving interventions, and optimal simulated teams generated using genetic algorithm procedures. Our results offer insights about the potential for different interventions to affect team performance. Moreover, certain interventions may promote discussions about key issues (e.g., tactical strategies) and facilitate shifting among transition processes in a manner that emulates optimal simulated teams' communication patterns. Thus, we contribute to theory regarding team processes in 2 important ways. First, we present process shifts as a way to explore the timing of when teams shift from transition to action processes. Second, we use virtual experimentation to identify those interventions with the greatest potential to affect performance by changing when teams shift among processes. Additionally, we employ computational methods including neural networks, simulation, and optimization, thereby demonstrating their applicability in conducting team research.},

One approach in particular, called joint modeling, attempts to model the covariation between the parameters of " submodels " intended to capture im-portant patterns in each stream of data. Joint models present an interesting opportunity to transcend conventional levels of analyses (e.g., Marr's hierar-chy; Marr, 1982) by providing fully integrative models (Love, 2015). In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial of two flavors of joint models – the Directed and Covariance approaches. Computational procedures have been developed to apply these approaches to a number of cognitive tasks, yet neither have been made accessible to a wider audience. Here, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to develop submodels of each stream of data, as well as how to link the important model parameters to form one cohesive model.

abstract = {We consider four scenarios that can unfold when organizations either innovate or respond rigidly to organizational decline. Two of the scenarios are downward spirals that threaten an organization with possible death, and two of the scenarios are turnarounds. These scenarios are important because they can determine the fate of an organization—survival or death. We explore the conditions under which each of these scenarios is likely to emerge, developing original theory and specifying propositions about those conditions. In developing this theoretical framework, we distinguish between flexible and inflexible innovations as factors in turnaround success or failure. Our model extends current theory on organizational decline to highlight the feedback effects of the consequences of decline and to explain the circumstances in which particular feedback effects are likely to occur.},

abstract = {The goal of this research was to examine the ways in which human operators interact with simulated semiautonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), semiauto- nomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and teleoperated UGVs (Teleop). Ro- botic operators performed parallel route reconnaissance missions with each platform alone and with all three platforms. When given all three platforms, participants failed to detect more targets than when given only the UAV or UGV; they were also less likely to complete their mission in the allotted time. Target detection during missions was the poorest with the Teleop alone, likely because of the demands of remote driv- ing. Spatial abilitywas found to be a good predictor of target-detection performance. However, slowing sensor feed video frame rate or the imposition of a short response latency (250 ms) between Teleop control and Teleop reaction failed to affect tar- get-detection performance significantly. Nevertheless, these video image manipula- tions did influence assessment of system usability.},

abstract = {Means of goal attainment are said to be multifinal when they are capable of attaining more than 1 goal at the same time. Such means have an advantage over unifinal means because they have the potential to attain greater overall value. However, they have the disadvantage (relative to unifinal means) of diluting the association between the means and each of the goals (Zhang, Fishbach, {\&} Kruglanski, 2007). In turn, diluted association strength is often interpreted as reduced means' instrumentality. Given these tradeoffs between value (favoring a multifinal option) and instrumentality (favoring the unifinal option), the question is under what conditions 1 or the other would be selected. Based on regulatory mode theory (Higgins, Kruglanski, {\&} Pierro, 2003; Kruglanski et al., 2000), we predicted and found in 5 experiments that individuals operating in a locomotion self-regulatory mode prefer a unifinal to multifinal means, whereas individuals operating in an assessment mode prefer multifinal to unifinal means. Implications of these findings for self-regulatory phenomena are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

We assume that the sample reflects both the immediate distribution of attribute values from the current decision's context and also the background, real-world distribution of attribute values.

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study sought to establish the effects of caffeine on sleep inertia, which is the ubiquitous phenomenon of cognitive performance impairment, grogginess and tendency to return to sleep immediately after awakening. DESIGN: 28 normal adult volunteers were administered sustained low-dose caffeine or placebo (randomized double-blind) during the last 66 hours of an 88-hour period of extended wakefulness that included seven 2-hour naps during which polysomnographical recordings were made. Every 2 hours of wakefulness, and immediately after abrupt awakening from the naps, psychomotor vigilance performance was tested. SETTING: N/A. PARTICIPANTS: N/A. Interventions: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In the placebo condition, sleep inertia was manifested as significantly impaired psychomotor vigilance upon awakening from the naps. This impairment was absent in the caffeine condition. Caffeine had only modest effects on nap sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine was efficacious in overcoming sleep inertia. This suggests a reason for the popularity of caffeine-containing beverages after awakening. Caffeine's main mechanism of action on the central nervous system is antagonism of adenosine receptors. Thus, increased adenosine in the brain upon awakening may be the cause of sleep inertia.},

R. M. Roe, J. R. Busemeyer, and J. T. Townsend (2001) have proposed a linear model in which effects previously attributed to loss aversion (A. Tversky {\&} D.

However, there are several reasons to maintain loss aversion in a theory of choice. In view of this, an alternative theory is proposed, integrating loss aversion and attention switching into a nonlinear model (M. Usher {\&} J. L. McClelland, 2001) that relies on inhibition independent of similarity among alternatives. The model accounts for the 3 effects and makes testable predictions contrasting with those of the Roe et al.

After this certain badge, the difficulty level suddenly drops and remains constant throughout up to the last badge in the hierarchy. Our findings indicate that after successful badge achievement users increase their subsequent effort to attain the next badge, but only as long as badges represent a challenge to the user. According to our analysis, we identify self-learning to be the key driver of this behavior.},

The Matlab-based simulator allows the comparison of a number of learning policies (represented as a series of .m modules) in the context of a wide range of problems (each represented in its own .m module) which makes it easy to add new algorithms and new test problems. State-of-the-art policies and various problem classes are provided in the package. The choice of problems and policies is guided through a spreadsheet-based interface. Different graphical metrics are included. MOLTE is designed to be compatible with parallel computing to scale up from local desktop to clusters and clouds. We offer MOLTE as an easy-to-use tool for the research community that will make it possible to perform much more comprehensive testing, spanning a broader selection of algorithms and test problems. We demonstrate the capabilities of MOLTE through a series of comparisons of policies on a starter library of test problems. We also address the problem of tuning and constructing priors that have been largely overlooked in optimal learning literature. We envision MOLTE as a modest spur to provide researchers an easy environment to study interesting questions involved in optimal learning.},

abstract = {Behavioral and economic theories have long maintained that actions are chosen so as to minimize demands for exertion or work, a principle sometimes referred to as the law of less work. The data supporting this idea pertain almost entirely to demands for physical effort. However, the same minimization principle has often been assumed also to apply to cognitive demand. The authors set out to evaluate the validity of this assumption. In 6 behavioral experiments, participants chose freely between courses of action associated with different levels of demand for controlled information processing. Together, the results of these experiments revealed a bias in favor of the less demanding course of action. The bias was obtained across a range of choice settings and demand manipulations and was not wholly attributable to strategic avoidance of errors, minimization of time on task, or maximization of the rate of goal achievement. It is remarkable that the effect also did not depend on awareness of the demand manipulation. Consistent with a motivational account, avoidance of demand displayed sensitivity to task incentives and covaried with individual differences in the efficacy of executive control. The findings reported, together with convergent neuroscientific evidence, lend support to the idea that anticipated cognitive demand plays a significant role in behavioral decision making.},

abstract = {Many models of motivation suggest that goals can be arranged in a hierarchy, ranging from higher-level goals that represent desired end-states to lower-level means that operate in the service of those goals. We present a hierarchical model that distinguishes between three levels—goals, strategies, and tactics—and between approach/avoidance and regulatory focus motivations at different levels. We focus our discussion on how this hierarchical framework sheds light on the different ways that success and failure are defined within the promotion and prevention systems outlined in regulatory focus theory. Specifically, we review research that demonstrates that differences in what “counts” as success versus failure in these systems have important implications for motivational strength, emotional responses, and risky behavior.},

abstract = {Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory postulates personality factors of 'reward sensitivity' and 'punishment sensitivity' linked to neural systems that control approach and avoidance, respectively. In contrast, behavioural economics distinguishes gain ('reward') and loss ('punishment') valuation systems that are orthogonal to approach/avoidance behaviour. We combined gain and loss with both their presentation and omission and found evidence for separate gain valuation, loss valuation, approach, and avoidance systems. This suggests that it is possible to integrate valuation/input and behaviour/output views of 'reward' and 'punishment' in a way that may be of use to both personality theory and economics and so forge closer links between these two major perspectives on decision-making and behaviour. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Task allocation is one of the keys to maximize organizational benefits by handling as many tasks as possible. Many computational multi-agent systems use agent's capability for task allocation. When a task arrives at the queue to be delivered a task allocator will determine which takes the task by finding the best-capable agent. In real world situation, each agent should not only consider the new task with their capability, but also tasks that they are currently handling before sending their capability to the task allocator. This research study proposes a CPU-scheduling based algorithm to allow agents to perform rational decision making when they think that they can handle the new task while taking care of its current tasks. The result shows that applying algorithm provide a significant improvement of their performance.},

@incollection{Akerstedt2014,
abstract = {Torbj{\"{o}} rn {\AA} kerstedt Other chapters have covered the potential problems of high sleepiness—reduced performance and increased accident risk (see also [8]). Other chapters have also discussed the determinants of sleepiness. To recapitulate, the main factors include sleep duration, time spent awake since awakening, and circadian phase (or time of day). There are other factors that will influence sleepiness, but they are relatively acute and contextual, for example, monotony, physical activity, drugs, etc., will not be dealt with here. There are several reasons for developing models sleep/wake regulation. First, it would be of practical and theoretical interest to be able to predict the effects of altered sleep/wake patterns on alertness and accident risk. Thus, a model may be used when planning work schedules to avoid fatigue risk. It might also be used by individuals for understanding the risk involved in changing the timing or duration of sleep for personal reasons (traveling, hobbies, social interaction). A related use is for online, ambulatory advice on sleepiness risk. This may have the form of activity measurement as input into a mathematical model that in a feed-back mode informs the user of risk, the need for sleep and when to sleep. This type of device might also include information on the amount of sleep that would be obtained after different bedtime alternatives or when sleep should be sought (and how much) in order to maintain alertness on levels below those where risk is present. A final application may be education. We have noticed that interactive models that respond immediately to changes in sleep duration or time of sleep initiation may lead to profound understanding of the way the sleep regulatory system works and where the dangers may lie. S. Garbarino et al. (eds.), Sleepiness and Human Impact Assessment, DOI: 10.1007/978-88-470-5388-5{\_}5, {\'{O}} Springer-Verlag Italia 2014 63 Apart from the applied/predictive aspect of model use a model also functions as an explanatory short-cut. If performance is acceptable, it may serve to explain complicated mechanisms behind sleepiness and sleep. This may include the sep-arate contributions of circadian and homeostatic regulation inherent in all models. One might conceive that different types of contexts, individuals, etc., may modify the relations between the components of the model. Obviously a model of sleep/ wake regulation may also be used to generate research hypothesis. The original two-process model of Borb{\'{e}}ly [11] was designed to predict sleep duration, but inspired others to develop models for sleep (or performance) prediction. It was based on body temperature data for circadian regulation, poly-somnographical data for sleep duration, and rate of recovery [based on sleep stages 3 ? 4—slow wave sleep (SWS)] during sleep and build-up of need for recovery during waking (based on the increasing amount of SWS during naps with increasing distance from the time of awakening). Since the two-process model did not focus on sleepiness per se this regulation is described using the parameters of the first model to carry Borb{\'{e}}ly's work further to sleepiness prediction—the ''three-process model of alertness regulation'' (TPM).},

@article{Sitzmann2011,
abstract = {Researchers have been applying their knowledge of goal-oriented behavior to the self-regulated learning domain for more than 30 years. This review examines the current state of research on self-regulated learning and gaps in the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning of work-related knowledge and skills. Self-regulation theory was used as a conceptual lens for deriving a heuristic framework of 16 fundamental constructs that constitute self-regulated learning. Meta-analytic findings (k=430, N=90,380) support theoretical propositions that self-regulation constructs are interrelated-30{\%} of the corrected correlations among constructs were .50 or greater. Goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy were the self-regulation constructs with the strongest effects on learning. Together these constructs accounted for 17{\%} of the variance in learning, after controlling for cognitive ability and pretraining knowledge. However, 4 self-regulatory processes-planning, monitoring, help seeking, and emotion control-did not exhibit significant relationships with learning. Thus, a parsimonious framework of the self-regulated learning domain is presented that focuses on a subset of self-regulatory processes that have both limited overlap with other core processes and meaningful effects on learning. Research is needed to advance the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning in an increasingly complex and knowledge-centric work environment. Such investigations should capture the dynamic nature of self-regulated learning, address the role of self-regulation in informal learning, and investigate how trainees regulate their transfer of training.},

abstract = {Mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. This research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. The development and psychometric properties of the dispositional Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) are described. Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. Finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.},

abstract = {Dynamical models of cognition play an increasingly important role in driving theoretical and experimental research in psychology. Therefore, parameter estimation, model analysis and compar-ison of dynamical models are of essential importance. In this article, we propose a maximum likelihood approach for model analysis in a fully dynamical framework that includes time-ordered experimental data. Our methods can be applied to dynamical models for the prediction of discrete behavior (e.g., movement onsets); in particular, we use a dynamical model of saccade generation in scene viewing as a case study for our approach. For this model, the likelihood function can be computed directly by numerical simulation, which enables more efficient parameter estimation including Bayesian inference to obtain reliable estimates and corresponding credible intervals. Using hierarchical models inference is even possible for individual observers. Furthermore, our likelihood approach can be used to compare different models. In our example, the dynamical framework is shown to outperform nondynamical statistical models. Additionally, the likelihood based evaluation differentiates model variants, which produced indistinguishable predictions on hitherto used statis-tics. Our results indicate that the likelihood approach is a promising framework for dynamical cognitive models. The broad class of dynamical cognitive models (Van Gelder, 1998) provides a powerful framework for explaining behavioral data. This modeling approach has been particularly successful in sensorimotor control. For example, an early paradigmatic model was proposed by Haken, Kelso, and Bunz (1985) who introduced coupled nonlinear oscillators as a mathematical model for phase transitions in human finger movements. Another general theory was proposed by Erlhagen and Sch{\"{o}}ner (2002), who introduced a flexible framework of movement preparation based on dynamical equations for the temporal evolution of neural fields that specify motor actions in space and time. With their decision field theory, Busemeyer and Townsend (1993) developed a dynamical frame-work for decision making in uncertain environments. These rep-resentative examples indicate the broad range of dynamical models in cognitive science. A strength of the dynamical approach is to generate specific predictions, including the dependencies between different data-points over time. This, however, implies that the statistical treatment of dynamical models requires the comparison of model predictions for time-ordered and interdependent data, which complicates parameter identification and model compar-ison. As a result, dynamical models are often handled with heuristic and approximate methods. In this article, we discuss},

Experiment 1 showed that error responses speed up relative to correct responses under instructions to respond quickly. Experiment 2 showed that that responses to less probable stimuli are slower and less accurate than responses to more probable stimuli. The data from both experiments support the diffusion model for lexical decision (Ratcliff, Gomez, {\&} McKoon, 2004). At the same time, the data provide evidence against the popular deadline model for lexical decision. The deadline model assumes that "nonword" responses are given only after the "word" response has timed out - consequently, the deadline model cannot account for the data from experimental conditions in which "nonword" responses are systematically faster than "word" responses.},

One particular practice that has become common is 'reverse inference', by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region. Such inferences are not deductively valid, but can still provide some information. Using a Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database, I characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference. Its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest. I argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference, particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In my comments on the paper by Jackson, Hill, and Roberts (2012), I discuss the arbitrary nature of " disposition " and question whether an essentially atheoretical computer-structured inventory based on a mixture of superficially assessed habitual behaviors constitutes a theory of personality. In another set of comments, which speak to the paper by Vancouver (2012), I identify two major flaws in Powers' (1991) perceptual control theory and document experimental compromises in Vancouver's efforts to demonstrate that goals and self-efficacy operate counteractively. My comments on the Yeo and Neal (2013) paper center on their unsuccessful efforts to explain and verify the proposition that general and specific self-efficacy work at cross-purposes. In response to Bledow's (2013) entry, I address the conceptual ambiguity of his theory of unconscious self-motivation, misconstruals of the role of self-efficacy in the process of change, and marginalization of the functional role of consciousness in human behavior. In a publicized, lengthy commentary in this journal, I addressed theoretical, methodologi-cal, analytical, and interpretational aspects of research on perceived self-efficacy (Bandura, 2012). Readers were invited to submit commentaries on this article. Four sets of replies were published from different theoretical perspectives. They included Powers' perceptual control theory, a trait theory with opposing functional self-efficacy properties, Big Five personality theory, and an approach that marginalizes the role of consciousness in human functioning.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential choice literature – similarity, attraction, and compromise effects – all occur within a single perceptual decision task.

abstract = {The goal-gradient hypothesis denotes the classic finding from behaviorism that animals expend more effort as they approach a reward. Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems, and Tobit and logit models. The key findings indicate that (1) participants in a real caf{\'{e}} reward program purchase coffee more frequently the closer they are to earning a free coffee; (2) Internet users who rate songs in return for reward certificates visit the rating Web site more often, rate more songs per visit, and persist longer in the rating effort as they approach the reward goal; (3) the illusion of progress toward the goal induces purchase acceleration (e.g., customers who receive a 12-stamp coffee card with 2 preexisting "bonus" stamps complete the 10 required purchases faster than customers who receive a "regular" 10-stamp card); and (4) a stronger tendency to accelerate toward the goal predicts greater retention and faster reengagement in the program. The conceptualization and empirical findings are captured by a parsimonious goal-distance model, in which effort investment is a function of the proportion of original distance remaining to the goal. In addition, using statistical and experimental controls, the authors rule out alternative explanations for the observed goal gradients. They discuss the theoretical significance of their findings and the managerial implications for incentive systems, promotions, and customer retention.},

The height of a decision threshold applied to accumulating information on each trial determines a speed–accuracy tradeoff (SAT) for the DDM, thereby accounting for a ubiquitous feature of human performance in speeded response tasks. However, little is known about how participants settle on particular tradeoffs. One possibility is that they select SATs that maximize a subjective rate of reward earned for performance. For the DDM, there exist unique, reward-rate-maximizing values for its threshold and starting point parameters in free-response tasks that reward correct responses (R. Bogacz, E. Brown, J. Moehlis, P. Holmes, {\&} J. D. Cohen, 2006). These optimal values vary as a function of response–stimulus interval, prior stimulus probability, and relative reward magnitude for correct responses. We tested the resulting quantitative predictions regarding response time, accuracy, and response bias under these task manipulations and found that grouped data conformed well to the predictions of an optimally parameterized DDM.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we present a sketch of how attention works within our cognitive system. By probing the mechanisms of attention, of which we are not by and large conscious, we illustrate how the interaction of attention with ongoing cognitive processing predisposes us to specific types of errors under certain circumstances, even with the best of intentions. Our goal is not to provide guidelines on how to “design for attention.” As much as we would like to do that, exact prescriptions will depend on the specific circumstances. Indeed, the current Department of Defense design document, MIL-STD-1472 (U.S. Department of Defense, 1999), specifies goals for attention management—for example, minimize distraction by providing only essential information (Section 5.2.6.13.7) and provide salient cuing (Section 5.2.6.13.8)—but does not specify how to achieve these goals. It also recommends using flashing (Section 5.14.3.3.2) or color (Section 5.14.3.3.1) without specifying under what conditions flashing or color will be effective or considering conditions under which it will not. Answers to these questions would require a detailed analysis of the tasks, procedures, and consequences of errors or delays in action in the context of application. We feel that a broad understanding of the mechanisms of attention will better assist the human systems engineer in considering the implications of design decisions for the management of attention.

Previous research has shed light both on the executive control functions that ultimately define cognitive labor and on a "default mode" of brain function that accompanies cognitive leisure. However, little is known about how labor/leisure decisions are actually made. Here, we identify a central principle guiding such decisions. Results from 3 economic-choice experiments indicate that the motivation underlying cognitive labor/leisure decision making is to strike an optimal balance between income and leisure, as given by a joint utility function. The results reported establish a new connection between microeconomics and research on executive function.

abstract = {A chief goal of perception is to help us navigate our environment. According to a rich and ambitious theory of spatial perception, the visual system achieves this goal not by aiming to accurately depict the external world, but instead by actively distorting the environment's perceived spatial layout to bias action selection toward favorable outcomes. Scores of experimental results have supported this view—including, famously, a report that wearing a heavy backpack makes hills look steeper. This perspective portrays the visual system as unapologetically paternalistic: Backpacks make hills harder to climb, so vision steepens them to discourage ascent. The “paternalistic” theory of spatial perception has, understandably, attracted controversy; if true, it would radically revise our understanding of how and why we see. Here, this view is subjected to a kind and degree of scrutiny it has yet to face. After characterizing and motivating the case for paternalistic vision, I expose several unexplored defects in its theoretical framework, arguing that extant accounts of how and why spatial perception is ability-sensitive are deeply problematic and that perceptual phenomenology belies the view's claims. The paternalistic account of spatial perception not only isn't true—it couldn't be true, even if its empirical findings were accepted at face value.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which individual differences in vulnerability to total sleep deprivation also reflect individual differences in vulnerability to multiple nights of sleep restriction. DESIGN: Two sleep loss conditions (order counterbalanced) separated by 2 to 4 weeks: (a) total sleep deprivation (TSD) of 2 nights (63 h continuous wakefulness); (b) sleep restriction (SR) of 7 nights of 3 h nightly time in bed (TIB). Both conditions were preceded by 7 in-laboratory nights with 10 h nightly TIB; and followed by 3 recovery nights with 8 h nightly TIB. Measures of cognitive performance (psychomotor vigilance, working memory [1-Back], and mathematical processing), objective alertness, subjective sleepiness, and mood were obtained at regular intervals under both conditions. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed using outcome metrics averaged over the last day (08:00-20:00) of TSD and SR. SETTING: Residential sleep/performance testing facility. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen healthy adults (ages 18-39; 11 males, 8 females). INTERVENTIONS: 2 nights of TSD and 7 nights SR (3 h nightly TIB). RESULTS: volunteers who displayed greater vulnerability to TSD displayed greater vulnerability to SR on cognitive performance tasks (ICC: PVT lapses = 0.89; PVT speed = 0.86; 1-Back = 0.88; mathematical processing = 0.68, Ps {\textless} 0.05). In addition, trait-like responsivity to TSD/SR was found for mood variables vigor (ICC = 0.91), fatigue (ICC = 0.73), and happiness (ICC = 0.85) (all Ps {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Resilience to sleep loss is a trait-like characteristic that reflects an individual's ability to maintain performance during both types of sleep loss (SR and TSD). Whether the findings extend to sleep schedules other than those investigated here (63 h of TSD and 7 nights of 3 h nightly TIB) will be the focus of future studies.},

abstract = {Many psychological experiments have participants repeat a simple task. This repetition is often necessary in order to gain the statistical precision required to answer questions about quantitative theories of the psychological processes underlying performance. In such experiments, time-on-task can have important and sizable effects on performance, changing the psychological processes under investigation in interesting ways. These changes are often ignored, and the underlying model is treated as static. We apply modern statistical approaches to extend a static model of decision-making to account for changes with time-on-task. Using data from three highly-cited experiments, we show that there are changes in performance with time-on-task, and that these changes vary substantially over individuals - both in magnitude and direction. Model-based analysis reveals how different cognitive processes contribute to the observed changes. We find strong evidence in favor of a first order autoregressive process governing the time-based evolution of individual subjects' model parameters. The central idea of our approach can be applied quite generally to quantitative psychological theories, beyond the model that we investigate and the experimental data that we use.},

After setting out a brief history of NDM we identify its essential characteristics and consider five of its main contributions: recognition-primed decisions, coping with uncertainty, team decision making, decision errors, and methodology. NDM helped identify important areas of inquiry previously neglected (e.g. the use of expertise in sizing up situations and generating options), it introduced new models, conceptualizations, and methods, and recruited applied investigators into the field. Above all, NDM contributed a new perspective on how decisions (broadly defined as committing oneself to a certain course of action) are made. NDM still faces significant challenges, including improvement of the quantity and rigor of its empirical research, and confirming the validity of its prescriptive models.

Important contributors to the DDM's success are the across-trial variability parameters, which allow the model to account for the various shapes of response time distributions encountered in practice. However, several researchers have pointed out that estimating the variability parameters can be a challenging task. Moreover, the numerous fitting methods for the DDM each come with their own associated problems and solutions. This often leaves users in a difficult position. In this collaborative project we invited researchers from the DDM community to apply their various fitting methods to simulated data and provide advice and expert guidance on estimating the DDM's across-trial variability parameters using these methods. Our study establishes a comprehensive reference resource and describes methods that can help to overcome the challenges associated with estimating the DDM's across-trial variability parameters.},

abstract = {Compared with approach motivation, avoidance motivation has often been related to reduced creativity because it evokes a relatively inflexible processing style. This finding seems inconsistent with the dual pathway to creativity model, which poses that both flexible and persistent processing styles can result in creative output. Reconciling these inconsistencies, the authors hypothesized that avoidance-motivated individuals are not unable to be creative, but they have to compensate for their inflexible processing style by effortful and controlled processing. Results of 5 experiments revealed that when individuals are avoidance motivated, they can be as creative as when they are approach motivated, but only when creativity is functional for goal achievement, motivating them to exert the extra effort (Experiments 1-4). The authors found that approach motivation was associated with cognitive flexibility and avoidance motivation with cognitive persistence (Experiment 1), that creative tasks are perceived to be more difficult by avoidance- than by approach-motivated individuals, and that avoidance-motivated individuals felt more depleted after creative performance (Experiment 2a, 2b, and 3). Finally, creative performance of avoidance-motivated individuals suffered more from a load on working memory (Study 4). The present results suggest that for people focusing on avoiding negative outcomes, creative performance is difficult and depleting, and they only pay these high cognitive costs when creativity helps achieving their goals.},

abstract = {Human children copy others' actions with high fidelity, supporting early cultural learning and assisting in the development and maintenance of behavioral traditions [1]. Imitation has long been assumed to occur from birth [2–4], with influential theories (e.g., [5–7]) placing an innate imitation module at the foundation of social cognition (potentially underpinned by a mirror neuron system [8, 9]). Yet, the very phenomenon of neonatal imitation has remained controversial. Empirical support is mixed and interpretations are varied [10–16], potentially because previous investigations have relied heavily on cross-sectional designs with relatively small samples and with limited controls [17, 18]. Here, we report surprising results from the most comprehensive longitudinal study of neonatal imitation to date. We presented infants (n = 106) with nine social and two non-social models and scored their responses at 1, 3, 6, and 9 weeks of age. Longitudinal analyses indicated that the infants did not imitate any of the models, as they were just as likely to produce the gestures in response to control models as they were to matching models. Previous positive findings were replicated in limited cross-sections of the data, but the overall analyses confirmed these findings to be mere artifacts of restricted comparison conditions. Our results undermine the idea of an innate imitation module and suggest that earlier studies reporting neonatal imitation were methodologically limited.},

abstract = {This individual differences study examined the separability of three often postulated executive functions-mental set shifting ("Shifting"), information updating and monitoring ("Updating"), and inhibition of prepotent responses ("Inhibition")-and their roles in complex "frontal lobe" or "executive" tasks. One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

In the analysis, response time distributions from numerous trials of the decision task are used to estimate a set of parameters mapping distinct cognitive processes. In recent years, diffusion model analyses have become more and more popular in different fields of psychology. This increased popularity is based on the recent development of several software solutions for the parameter estimation. Although these programs make the application of the model relatively easy, there is a shortage of knowledge about different steps of a state-of-the-art diffusion model study. In this paper, we give a concise tutorial on diffusion modeling, and we present fast-dm-30, a thoroughly revised and extended version of the fast-dm software (Voss and Voss, 2007) for diffusion model data analysis. The most important improvement of the fast-dm version is the possibility to choose between different optimization criteria (i.e., Maximum Likelihood, Chi-Square, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov), which differ in applicability for different data sets. Six years ago, we published fast-dm-26 (Voss and Voss, 2007). Since then, applications of diffusion models have thrived in different domains of psychology (Voss et al., 2013a): Although diffusion models are still far from being a standard method in the cognitive sciences, they are now suc-cessfully applied by many different researchers addressing a wide variety of research questions. Different aims of the application of diffusion models can roughly be grouped into three groups. A first type of diffusion model studies is interested in the development of cognitive models, and—specifically—in demonstrating that the diffusion model adequately describes the ongoing cognitive processes (e.g., Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff et al., 2004). For such studies, the key objective is demonstration of a good model fit, because a satisfactory model fit supports the assumption that actual cognitive processes are similar to the processes presumed by the model. Secondly, diffusion models can be used to test predictions from psychological theories (e.g., Voss et al., 2013b). For such studies the validity of the diffusion model for the applied task should be undisputed. The application of the diffusion model aims at getting valid measures for specific cognitive processes, which then are entered into further statistical analyses as dependent variables. With this technique it becomes possible to explain why response latencies are shorter in one con-dition compared to another condition. As detailed below, in the diffusion model framework, faster responses can be based on (1) fast information processing, (2) low response thresholds, or (3) fast response execution.},

abstract = {PROBLEM: Supervisors are increasingly important to the functioning of manufacturing operations, in large part due to their role as leaders. While supervisors' relations and communication with their subordinates are known to be important in influencing subordinates' behavior, little is known about how these two factors will impact subordinates' safety. This study investigated how much each factor contributes to safety-related outcomes for blue-collar production employees.

METHOD: Production employees at five Pennsylvania wood manufacturers completed a survey during their work shift. Five hundred and ninety eight employees provided data on leader-member exchange (LMX), safety communication, and safety-related events. Archival data on OSHA recordables were also obtained from the producers' human resources database.

RESULTS: Analyses found that the influence of LMX was greater than that of safety communication in predicting safety-related events. Neither LMX nor safety communication was significantly related to OSHA recordables. Results also demonstrated that employee job satisfaction and demographic variables such as gender and age have safety implications.

IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Results from this study further emphasize the importance of production supervisors and illustrate the potential role of leader-member exchange in enhancing workplace safety. Specifically, organizations should foster positive social exchange between their employees and supervisors and enhance the leadership qualities of supervisors to help reduce workplace injuries.},

However, self-regulation theories conceive of motivation as a function of various goal processes, and assert that the effect of self-efficacy should depend on the process involved. Training contexts may evoke planning processes in which self-efficacy might negatively relate to motivation. Yet the typical between-persons studies in the current literature may obscure the effect. To examine this issue, 63 undergraduate students completed a series of questionnaires measuring self-efficacy and motivation before 5 class exams. Self-efficacy was negatively related to motivation and exam performance at the within-person level of analysis, despite a significant positive relation with performance at the between-persons level.},

We focus on the value of conceptual replications, the attempt to test the same theoretical process as an existing study, but that uses methods that vary in some way from the previous study. The tension between the two kinds of replication is a tension of values—exact replications value confidence in operationalizations; their requirement tends to favor the status quo. Conceptual replications value confidence in theory; their use tends to favor rapid progress over ferreting out error. We describe the many ways in which conceptual replications can be superior to direct replications. We further argue that the social system of science is quite robust to these threats and is self-correcting.},

abstract = {A growing number of researchers have advocated for the advancement of cognitive neuroscience by blending cognitive models with neurophysiology. The recently proposed joint modeling framework is one way to bridge the gap between the abstractions assumed by cognitive models and the neurophysiology obtained by modern methods in neuroscience. Despite this advancement, the current method for linking the two domains is hindered by the dimensionality of the neural data. In this article, we present a new linking function based on factor analysis that allows joint models to grow linearly in complexity with increases in the number of neural features. The new linking function is then evaluated in two simulation studies. The first simulation study shows how the model parameters can be accurately recovered when there are many neural features, that mimics real-world applications. The second simulation shows how the new linking function can (1) properly recover a representation of the data generating model, even in the case of model misspecification, and (2) outperform the previous linking function in a cross-validation test. We close by applying a model equipped with the new linking function to real-world data from a perceptual decision making task. The model allows us to understand how differences in the model parameters emerge as a function of differences in brain function across speed and accuracy instruction.},

Addressing the prior plausibility of the model assumption is unavoidable if the goal is to determine how plausible it is that the model assumption holds. Without assessing the prior plausibility of the model assumptions, it remains fully uncertain whether the model of interest gives an adequate description of the data and thus whether it can be considered valid for the application at hand. Although addressing the prior plausibility is difficult, ignoring the prior plausibility is not an option if we want to claim that the inferences of our statistical model can be relied upon.},

Although hyperbolic discounting remains the dominant quantitative characterization of this phenomenon, a variety of models have been proposed and consensus around the one that most accurately describes behavior has been elusive. To help bring some clarity to this issue, we propose an Adaptive Design Optimization (ADO) method for fitting and comparing models of temporal discounting. We then conduct an ADO experiment aimed at discriminating among six popular models of temporal discounting. Rather than supporting a single underlying model, our results show that each model is inadequate in some way to describe the full range of behavior exhibited across subjects. The precision of results provided by ADO further identify specific properties of models, such as accommodating both increasing and decreasing impatience, that are mandatory to describe temporal discounting broadly.},

To keep the length of this paper within reasonable limits we discuss only the core cognitive abilities, such as perception, attention mechanisms, action selection, memory, learning and reasoning. In order to assess the breadth of practical applications of cognitive architectures we gathered information on over 900 practical projects implemented using the cognitive architectures in our list.

abstract = {Four experiments were conducted to investigate factors affecting relative arrival-time judgments in the transverse plane. Across experiments, results indicated an overreliance on relative distance information. The levels of relative velocity and distance used in the arrival-time task were proved discriminable, and performance in both relative velocity and distance judgments predicted perfor-mance in the relative arrival-time task. Despite the distance bias, an attempt to integrate relative velocity and distance information was also evidenced. The distance bias appears to have resulted from resource limitations on the concurrent processing of relative velocity and distance informa-tion, causing relative velocity information to become resource limited. The final experiment assessed the stability of performance in each of the tasks over time and provided evidence of individual differences in the ability to coordinate information from multiple sources. Many occupations require the ability to make decisions regarding spatial events that involve moving objects or rep-resentations of moving objects. Air traffic controllers, for example, must simultaneously assess and integrate informa-tion regarding the relative velocities and positions of nu-merous moving objects. Airplane pilots have a corresponding need to integrate their actions with information provided by both controllers and onboard instruments. Accordingly, their actions require efficient and veridical reasoning regarding dynamic spatial events. This article describes a systematic research effort that involved four experiments aimed at the analysis of the perceptual and cognitive factors governing individual and group differences in judgments of relative arrival time, velocity, and distance. Many researchers have studied time-to-contact judgments made by observers who either approach an object or are ap-proached by an object},

These arise in a host of experimental and everyday tasks where one is presented with an item and required to act based on memories linked with that item.

This chapter suggests that the range of need for continued efforts to catalogue and explore the different control processes, decision heuristics, memory representations, and perhaps even personality factors that govern the way subjects make item-based memory attributions when faced with noisy and complex memory evidence.},

On the basis of previously published data, we compare the classi-fication behavior of a group of children with HFASD with that of typically developing (TD) controls using a computa-tional model of categorization. The parameters in the model reflect characteristics of information processing that are the-oretically related to HFASD. Because we expect individual differences in the model's parameters, as well as differences between HFASD and TD children, we use a hierarchical explanatory approach. A first analysis suggests that children with HFASD are less sensitive to the prototype. A sec-ond analysis, involving a mixture component, reveals that the computational model is not appropriate for a subgroup of participants, which implies parameter estimates are not informative for these children. Focusing only on the chil-dren for whom the prototype model is appropriate, no clear difference in sensitivity between HFASD and TD children is inferred.},

abstract = {Goals are constructs that direct choice behavior by guiding a decision maker towards desirable (or away from undesirable) end-states. Oftentimes, consumers are motivated to satisfy multiple goals within a single choice. While recognizing this possibility, the literature has not directly formulated models of choice as a multi-goal problem. We develop such a model, referred to as the Multiple-Goal-Based-Choice-Model, that incorporates 1) simultaneous multiple goal pursuit and 2) context-driven goal adaptation, but 3) does not require a priori identification of the number or nature of the goals. Goal adaptation within a single choice instance, allied to repeated choices, is the key to empirical identification of multiple latent goals. The proposed model is tested and supported using discrete choice experimental data on digital cameras via multiple validation exercises. The model can lead to significantly different policy implications with regards to consumers' valuation for new product designs, compared to extant utility-based choice models.},

@article{Pantzar2018,
abstract = {Objectives: Aerobic exercise influence cognition in elderly, children, and neuropsychiatric populations. Less is known about the influence of aerobic exercise in healthy samples (particularly working age), and of different fitness levels on cognition. Two hypotheses were posed: 1) low fitness levels, compared to moderate and high, will be related to poorer cognitive performance, and 2) breakpoints for the beneficial relationship between VO2 and cognition will be observed within the moderate-to-high fitness span. Design and Methods: The sample consisted of n=362 office workers. A submaximal cycle ergometer test estimated maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max, mL•kg-1•min-1). Based on estimated VO2max participants were split into tertiles; low (n=121), moderate (n=119), and high (n=122). A cognitive test battery (9 tests), assessed processing speed, working memory, executive functions and episodic memory. Results: Both hypotheses were confirmed. Groups of moderate (≈40) and high (≈49) fitness outperformed the group of low (≈31) fitness for inhibition and episodic recognition, whereas no significant differences between moderate and high fitness were observed (ANCOVAs). Breakpoints between benefits fromVO2max for inhibition and recognition were estimated to ≈44/43 mL•kg-1•min-1 (multivariate broken line regressions). Conclusions: Results suggest that it is conceivable to expect a beneficial relationship between VO2max and some cognitive domains up to a certain fitness level. In a sample of healthy office workers, this level was estimated to 44 mL•kg-1•min-1. This has implications on organizational and societal levels; where incentives to improve fitness levels from low to moderate could yield desirable cognitive and health benefits in adults.},

Yet, results of our literature review, including more than 10,000 articles published in 15 journals from January 2001 and December 2010, indicate that Bayesian approaches are essentially absent from the organizational sciences. Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advan- tages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions. We hope that our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of Bayesian methods in organizational science research.},

The homeostatic Process S takes into account the prior history of sleep and waking. Process S rises and declines monotonically during waking and sleep, respectively. Its increase and decline were described by exponential functions. 2 The saturating exponential increase of S during waking was first derived from sleep deprivation data 2 and subsequently confirmed by a multiple nap protocol. 3,4 Slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG power in the 0.75–4.5 Hz range), a marker of sleep intensity, was used to determine the time course of Process S during sleep. 1,2,5,6 Parameter estimation in individuals is difficult. Therefore, pa-rameters of the decline of Process S were derived from average or pooled data across subjects. Generally, an exponential func-tion was fitted through pooled normalized mean SWA of NREM sleep episodes plotted at episode midpoints. Our aim now was to establish a reliable and stable method of parameter estimation of Process S that can be applied to individual data. Our method is based on an elaboration of the approach used previously.},

abstract = {Although the self-concordance of goals has been repeatedly shown to predict better goal progress, recent research suggests potential problems with aggregating autonomous and controlled motivations to form a summary index of self-concordance (Judge, Bono, Erez, {\&} Locke, 2005). The purpose of the present investigation was to further examine the relations among autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and goal progress to determine the relative importance of autonomous motivation and controlled motivation in the pursuit of personal goals. The results of three studies and a meta-analysis indicated that autonomous motivation was substantially related to goal progress whereas controlled motivation was not. Additionally, the relation of autonomous motivation to goal progress was shown to involve implementation planning. Together, the three studies highlight the importance for goal setters of having autonomous motivation and developing implementation plans, especially ones formulated in terms of approach strategies rather than avoidance strategies. The present research suggests that individuals pursuing goals should focus relatively greater attention on enhancing their autonomous motivation rather than reducing their controlled motivation.},

abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

abstract = {Many environmental and risk management decisions are made jointly by technical experts and members of the public. Frequently, their task is to select from among management alternatives whose outcomes are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. Although it is recognized that how this uncertainty is interpreted can significantly affect decision-making processes and choices, little research has examined similarities and differences between expert and public understandings of uncertainty. We present results from a web-based survey that directly compares expert and lay interpretations and understandings of different expressions of uncertainty in the context of evaluating the consequences of proposed environmental management actions. Participants responded to two hypothetical but realistic scenarios involving trade-offs between environmental and other objectives and were asked a series of questions about their comprehension of the uncertainty information, their preferred choice among the alternatives, and the associated difficulty and amount of effort. Results demonstrate that experts and laypersons tend to use presentations of numerical ranges and evaluative labels differently; interestingly, the observed differences between the two groups were not explained by differences in numeracy or concerns for the predicted environmental losses. These findings question many of the usual presumptions about how uncertainty should be presented as part of deliberative risk- and environmental-management processes.},

However, this literature has been limited to description-based choice tasks in which possible outcomes and their probabilities are explicitly specified. A recent literature has emerged showing that many core results found using the description paradigm do not generalize to experience-based choice tasks in which possible outcomes and their probabilities are learned from sequential sampling. In the current study, we investigated whether this description-experience choice gap occurs in the long run. We examined description- and experience-based preferences under two traditional short run framed choice tasks (single-play, repeated-play) and also a long-run frame (multi-play). We found a reduction in the size of the description-experience gap in the long-run frame, which was attributable to greater choice maximizing in the description format and reduced overweighting of rare events in the experience format. We interpret these results as a "broad bracketing" effect: the long-run mindset attenuates short-run biases such as loss aversion and reliance on small samples. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {When deciding between two alternatives, such as whether to order the pasta or the chicken, or whether to pursue a career in academia or industry, a person may feel torn—as if the options literally pull him or her in two directions. This metaphor may have some surprising literal truth. If asked, for example, whether ‘‘murder is sometimes justified,'' individuals may be inclined to both agree and disagree with the statement. Here, we document, for the first time, the pull toward contrasting responses during evaluative thinking, reporting the results of a study examining the trajectory of participants' reaching movements toward dif- ferent response options. Our results suggest that a decision process is not necessarily completed in the brain's cognitive subsystems before it is shared with other subsystems, as has been traditionally assumed. Rather, simultaneous ‘‘pull'' from multiple response alternatives seems to influence the execution of movement itself. This finding suggests that a dynamic approach to mental processing—an approach that has already provided descriptions of perception, attention, and categorization (e.g., Abrams{\&}Balota, 1991; Gold {\&}Shadlen, 2000; Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Eriksen,{\&}Donchin, 1988; Hovland {\&} Sears, 1938; McClelland {\&} Rogers, 2003; Spivey, 2007; Tipper, Howard, {\&} Houghton, 1999)—may shed new light on high-level cognition (Roe, Busemeyer, {\&} Town- send, 2001; Townsend {\&} Busemeyer, 1989).},

Six types of cognitive load were analyzed to resolve ongoing controversies and to test current duration judgment theories. Duration judgments depend on whether or not participants are informed in advance that they are needed: prospective paradigm (informed) versus retrospective paradigm (not informed). With higher cognitive load, the prospective duration judgment ratio (subjective duration to objective duration) decreases but the retrospective ratio increases. Thus, the duration judgment ratio differs depending on the paradigm and the specific type of cognitive load. As assessed by the coefficient of variation, relative variability of prospective, but not retrospective, judgments increases with cognitive load. The prospective findings support models emphasizing attentional resources, especially executive control. The retrospective findings support models emphasizing memory changes. Alternative theories do not fit with the meta-analytic findings and are rejected. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Wallsten2005,
abstract = {This article models the cognitive processes underlying learning and sequential choice in a risk-taking task for the purposes of understanding how they occur in this moderately complex environment and how behavior in it relates to self-reported real-world risk taking. The best stochastic model assumes that participants incorrectly treat outcome probabilities as stationary, update probabilities in a Bayesian fashion, evaluate choice policies prior to rather than during responding, and maintain constant response sensitivity. The model parameter associated with subjective value of gains correlates well with external risk taking. Both the overall approach, which can be expanded as the basic paradigm is varied, and the specific results provide direction for theories of risky choice and for understanding risk taking as a public health problem. Cognitive psychologists and behavioral economists on the one hand and clinical psychologists on the other tend to study risk taking with different aims and in different ways. The former group, focusing on the basic processes underlying risk taking, tend to use laboratory methods and formal models as their research tools. In contrast, the latter, often with a public health focus, tend to use self-report methods to assess and, if possible, prevent risk-taking behaviors that have potential for harm or danger to the individual (Jessor, 1998; Leigh, 1999). There are exceptions in both direc-tions, with some economists and cognitive psychologists applying their models to noneconomic contexts in more naturalistic settings (e.g., Chapman, 1996; Hamalainen, Lindstedt, {\&} Sinkko, 2000; Wakker {\&} Stiggelbout, 1995) and with some clinical psychologists using experimental methods to study more basic processes (Be-chara, Damasio, Damasio, {\&} Anderson, 1994; Busemeyer {\&} Stout, 2002; Lejuez et al., 2002), but these are the exceptions rather than the rule. This article combines the two approaches by deriving and test-ing models of the decision maker (DM) in a laboratory paradigm developed by Lejuez et al. (2002) called the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), which has been shown to identify individuals who are prone to highly risky behavior (Aklin, Lejuez, Zvolensky, Kahler, {\&} Gwadz, 2005; Lejuez et al., 2002; Lejuez, Aklin, Jones, et al., 2003; Lejuez, Aklin, Zvolensky, {\&} Pedulla, 2003; Lejuez, Simmons, Aklin, Daughters, {\&} Dvir, 2004). This paradigm is particularly interesting for at least three reasons. First, unlike many other paradigms that are used to evaluate static cognitive decision models, this one involves sequential risk taking with feedback. To be sure, most laboratory choice and decision-making experiments involve multiple trials or repeated plays, but the models used to understand behavior in those tasks almost always assume no change on the part of the participant as he or she proceeds through the session. In contrast, modeling how the DM learns from expe-rience is an important part of our challenge. Second, the basic BART paradigm is easily manipulated systematically, with corre-sponding changes in the models, in order ultimately to achieve a broad understanding of risk taking. Our present goals are more modest, but we return to this point in the Discussion section. Third, as already alluded to, analysis is at the level of the individual not the group, thereby providing a means for studying individual differences in risk taking and for relating laboratory and real-world behaviors. Our approach mirrors in many ways the pioneering work of Busemeyer and Stout (2002), who contrasted various models of the DM in the Bechera gambling task, which was designed to identify behavioral consequences of frontal lobe lesions (Bechara et al., 1994). Our plan in this article is first to position the present research within the broad topic of judgment, choice, and risk taking. Then, we describe the BART and briefly summarize its utility for assessing self-reported engagement in risky activities, including unprotected sex, delinquent behavior, and substance use. Next, we justify and develop multiple models of the DM's under-lying cognitive processes in the BART paradigm. The following section contrasts the models using data at the level of individual DMs and looks at the relationship between estimated model pa-rameters and reported real-world risk taking. The Discussion sec-tion, finally, considers what we have discovered about the nature},

One group of subjects estimated the projection duration on an analog scale, whereas the second group of subjects reproduced the intervals by pushing a button. Heart rate and skin conductance responses were also recorded during stimulus presentation as indices of attention and arousal. Time estimation results showed neither a main effect of valence nor a main effect of arousal. A highly significant valence x arousal interaction affected duration judgments. For low-arousal stimuli, the duration of negative slides was judged relatively shorter than the duration of positive slides. Fog high-arousal stimuli, the duration of negative slides was judged longer than the duration of positive slides. The same interaction pattern was observed across judgment modalities. These results are interpreted in terms of a model of action tendency, in which the level of arousal controls two different motivational mechanisms, one emotional and the other attentional.},

@article{Brown2005,
abstract = {Almost all models of response time (RT) use a stochastic accumulation process. To account for the benchmark RT phenomena, researchers have found it necessary to include between-trial variability in the starting point and/or the rate of accumulation, both in linear (R. Ratcliff {\&} J. N. Rouder, 1998) and nonlinear (M. Usher {\&} J. L. McClelland, 2001) models. The authors show that a ballistic (deterministic within-trial) model using a simplified version of M. Usher and J. L. McClelland's (2001) nonlinear accumulation process with between-trial variability in accumulation rate and starting point is capable of accounting for the benchmark behavioral phenomena. The authors successfully fit their model to R. Ratcliff and J. N. Rouder's (1998) data, which exhibit many of the benchmark phenomena. Even for fast and easy decisions, " a simple summation of sensory and motor transduction delays and conduction times in the nervous system cannot account for the duration and variability of reaction times " (Hanes {\&} Schall, 1996, p. 427). The slowness and variability of response time (RT) has been almost universally explained by decision processes involving stochastic accumulation of information. Stochastic models assume that the accumulated information varies randomly from moment to moment during the decision process. RT is relatively slow because a criterion amount of information must be accumulated before a response is made, and RT is variable because stochastic accumulation causes vari-ability in the amount of time required to reach the criterion. The existence of within-decision variability in information accumula-tion is not just a theoretical convenience; it has been imbued with psychological importance as instantiating a process of sequential sampling. We propose a ballistic accumulation (BA) model in which the accumulation process during a trial is deterministic rather than stochastic. We demonstrate that the BA model can provide a general account of choice RT in both time-controlled and information-controlled paradigms. Time-controlled choice tasks require subjects to make decisions at a range of deadlines after the onset of the stimulus. Interest focuses on the growth of accuracy with time, the speed–accuracy trade-off (SAT) function (see, e.g., Luce, 1986, pp. 237–245). Information-controlled tasks require subjects to make a decision when they feel a criterion amount of information has accumulated, with the criterion set according to task demands, such as an emphasis on accuracy or speed. Interest focuses on RT for both correct and error responses, as well as accuracy. To account for SAT, stochastic models such as Ratcliff and Rouder's (1998) diffusion model and Usher and McClelland's (2001) leaky competitive accumulator model have also had to incorporate two sources of between-trial variability, in input strength and in the starting point of evidence accumulation. 1 The BA model incorporates only these between-trial sources; it is a simplified deterministic version of the Usher and McClelland model. Dropping the stochastic component reduces model com-plexity, both analytically and computationally. More importantly, it represents a fundamental change in the psychological interpre-tation of the model; it can no longer be interpreted as a sequential-sampling process. The fits of the BA model reported below also revealed a fundamental change in model dynamics relative to the fitted version of Usher and McClelland's stochastic model. The fitted BA model displayed " winner-takes-all " behavior that is due to much stronger response competition. In the Ballistic Leaky Competitive Accumulator Model section we describe the BA model and show how it can account for SAT in time-controlled paradigms. We then fit the model to Ratcliff and Rouder's data from an information-controlled paradigm. Those data total around 10,000 observations from each of 3 participants (Ratcliff {\&} Roud-er's, 1998, Subjects K.R., J.F., and N.H.) in a two-alternative forced-choice perceptual categorization task.},

Feedback timing and feedback specificity demonstrated both main and interaction effects on resource allocations. Results also demonstrated that performers do better on tasks for which higher quality feedback is available; this effect was mediated by resources allocated to tasks. The practical and theoretical implications of the role of the feedback environment in managing performance are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved).},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. The pragmatic character of the Dutch book argument makes it unsuitable as an "epi-stemic" justification for the fundamental probabilist dogma that rational partial beliefs must conform to the axioms of probability. To secure an appropriately epistemic jus-tification for this conclusion, one must explain what it means for a system of partial beliefs to accurately represent the state of the world, and then show that partial beliefs that violate the laws of probability are invariably less accurate than they could be otherwise. The first task can be accomplished once we realize that the accuracy of systems of partial beliefs can be measured on a gradational scale that satisfies a small set of formal constraints, each of which has a sound epistemic motivation. When ac-curacy is measured in this way it can be shown that any system of degrees of belief that violates the axioms of probability can be replaced by an alternative system that obeys the axioms and yet is more accurate in every possible world. Since epistemically rational agents must strive to hold accurate beliefs, this establishes conformity with the axioms of probability as a norm of epistemic rationality whatever its prudential merits or defects might be.},

@article{VandenBerg2016,
abstract = {Demanding tasks often require a series of decisions to reach a goal. Recent progress in perceptual decision-making has served to unite decision accuracy, speed, and confidence in a common framework of bounded evidence accumulation, furnishing a platform for the study of such multi-stage decisions. In many instances, the strategy applied to each decision, such as the speed-accuracy trade-off, ought to depend on the accuracy of the previous decisions. However, as the accuracy of each decision is often unknown to the decision maker, we hypothesized that subjects may carry forward a level of confidence in previous decisions to affect subsequent decisions. Subjects made two perceptual decisions sequentially and were rewarded only if they made both correctly. The speed and accuracy of individual decisions were explained by noisy evidence accumulation to a terminating bound. We found that subjects adjusted their speed-accuracy setting by elevating the termination bound on the second decision in proportion to their confidence in the first. The findings reveal a novel role for confidence and a degree of flexibility, hitherto unknown, in the brain's ability to rapidly and precisely modify the mechanisms that control the termination of a decision.},

Using a within-subject experimental design, participants in 2 studies repeatedly choose among sets of options (consumer products) described on several attributes. The results of Study 1 showed that all models predicted participants' choices equally well. In Study 2, in which the choice sets were explicitly designed to distinguish the models, MDFT had an advantage in predicting the observed choices. Study 2 further revealed the occurrence of multiple context effects within single participants, indicating an interdependent evaluation of choice options and correlations between different context effects. In sum, the results indicate that sequential sampling models can provide relevant insights into the cognitive process underlying preferential choices and thus can lead to better choice predictions.},

abstract = {In recent years, statisticians and psychologists have provided the critique that p-values do not capture the evidence afforded by data and are, consequently, ill suited for analysis in scientific endeavors. The issue is particular salient in the assessment of the recent evidence provided for ESP by Bem (2011) in the mainstream Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, and van der Maas (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100, 426-432, 2011) have provided an alternative Bayes factor assessment of Bem's data, but their assessment was limited to examining each experiment in isolation. We show here that the variant of the Bayes factor employed by Wagenmakers et al. is inappropriate for making assessments across multiple experiments, and cannot be used to gain an accurate assessment of the total evidence in Bem's data. We develop a meta-analytic Bayes factor that describes how researchers should update their prior beliefs about the odds of hypotheses in light of data across several experiments. We find that the evidence that people can feel the future with neutral and erotic stimuli to be slight, with Bayes factors of 3.23 and 1.57, respectively. There is some evidence, however, for the hypothesis that people can feel the future with emotionally valenced nonerotic stimuli, with a Bayes factor of about 40. Although this value is certainly noteworthy, we believe it is orders of magnitude lower than what is required to overcome appropriate skepticism of ESP.},
